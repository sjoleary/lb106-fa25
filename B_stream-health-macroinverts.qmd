# Exploring macroinvertebrate biodiversity of Piscataquog headwaters

In this second unit, we will visit two of our headwater streams and collect macroinvertebrates, we will then determine which taxonomic groups they belong to^[we will identify the orders and families they belong to], and use that information to assess and compare the ecosystem health of Rand Brook and Schoolhouse brook.
