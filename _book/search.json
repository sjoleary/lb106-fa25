    "text": "1 Preface\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to our lab handbook for Introduction to Environmental Science (Fall 2025) - it will be continuously updated throughout the semester.\nOur lab component will comprise a semester long project exploring our local watershed. Our lab activities will produce data that is part of an ongoing collaborative research project investigating the effects of stream temperature variability on biodiversity across diverse geographic regions and urban/rural locations. You will have the opportunity to develop your own hypotheses and experiments and be exposed to a range of methods for data collection and analysis commonly employed in the environmental sciences, including field methods for sampling aquatic macroinvertebrates, using keys for species identification, computational tools of analyzing and visualizing stream temperature variability and species diversity, and GIS (geographic information systems). Our lab will have three parts, in the first few weeks you will be introduced to the local watershed and then you will spend the remaining semester developing your own research projects in groups and we will collect and analyze the data for your projects.\n\nPart 1: Exploring the hydrological, physical, and chemical characteristics of the Piscataquog watershed and headwater streams.\nPart 2: Research projects: Macroinvertebrate diversity of two headwater streams\nPart 3: Research Projects: Microplastics\n\nOver the course of the semester you will become increasingly independent in your ability engage in all aspects of the scientific process, starting with making observations on the foundation of which you will formulate a hypothesis, design an experiment to test this hypothesis and make predictions about the outcome, collect, visualize, and analyze data, and report your findings in a written format.\nAfter completing the lab component of this course, you will have a fundamental skill set that will allow you to\n\nmake observations and use these to formulate a question and generate a hypothesis.\ndesign an appropriate experiment to generate and collect data to answer your question.\ncollect, visualize, and analyze data using appropriate qualitative and quantitative methods.\ncommunicate your research findings to a general audience.\n\nFor the lab component of this course to run smoothly, you will need to take an active role in preparing for and participating in lab. It is your responsibility to be aware of communications made in the syllabus, through announcements on Canvas, or emails. While it is always our goal to make those in a timely fashion, some last minute calls may be unavoidable. Similarly, you are expected to arrive for your lab period on time and prepared for the planned activities, including completing all assigned tasks and/or reading assignments, bringing your laptop and charger, along with any lab-related handouts1. We will be working with a lot of digital documents this semester, avoid last minute computer-related disasters by saving your work frequently and regularly backing up your files on an external drive or the cloud that you can access from another computer. If you run into issues where you will not have access to a laptop, contact your instructor and Dr. O’Leary as quickly as possible so we can make sure you can participate e.g. by finding you an alternate laptop to complete assignment in/out of lab.1 For documents that are digital including write-ups of your study design, spreadsheets with data etc. make sure that you can easily access those during lab periods. For any hard copies make sure that you print those and bring them with you as instructed.\nAll members of a lab group are expected to contribute to the design of each project along with collecting and analyzing data. It’s important that you establish a good working relationship with your group and hold each other accountable for the contributions that you make to this project; this may involve scheduling meetings outside of lab time. Strive to be a good team player by making sure you are responsive to your group and have open lines of communication to arrange meetings and complete assignments. We will frequently combine data sets within and across groups to get large sample sizes and/or replicates, therefore it is critical that you complete out-of-lab assignments by the posted deadlines in order for your group to be able to progress through the research projects. Procrastination is frequently at the root of assignments not being completed well. When you are collaborating with others be mindful that your time management will impact the time management of others. Account for this both when you plan as a group how to divide up work and in how you complete tasks assigned to you by making sure to get started early enough to not hold up your group. While it is primarily your responsibility to coordinate and work with your group, if you are having difficulties with group members not contributing as agreed upon or other problems working together, please reach out to Dr. O’Leary or your lab instructor and we will step in to help facilitate a solution.\nAttendance in lab is mandatory. You are allowed one absence per semester. You should always inform both your instructor and Dr. O’Leary in writing (an email) of your absence before lab. If you will be missing lab due to a direct conflict with a planned college-sponsored event you must contact your instructor and Dr. O’Leary at least one week in advance as that will give us more flexibility in planning how you can complete the lab and/or assign alternative activities. Regardless of the reason you are missing lab, you are responsible for material covered in lab and completing any pre-lab and/or homework assignments associated with a missed lab period; we will communicate with you in which form you will need to make-up in-lab assignments and activities. Additionally, you should always contact your group members for the project(s) you are currently working on as soon as possible to learn what you will be responsible for on any group assignments.\nThis semester will include some field-based activities. Your safety is always a priority and while it is always our goal to design activities that are accessible to everyone and minimize risk there are more factors that we cannot control outside of the lab. Help us out by using common sense, keeping an eye on your lab mates, and advocating for yourself. For field-based activities please make sure that you check the weather conditions ahead of time and then ensure you are appropriately dressed in terms of layers to stay warm or cool, with shoes that can get muddy or wet. If it is sunny/hot out make sure to wear sun screen and/or a head covering, bring water etc. if you have any allergies or other medical conditions that might require emergency treatment, please let your instructor know and carry any medication you might need on you (inhaler, EpiPen, etc). Occasionally there may be unavoidable weather-related last minute changes, please make sure to check your email/Canvas for last minute notifications. If you are doing any field work on your own outside of lab time, please be mindful of your safety, at the very least let somebody know where you are going and when you expect to be back, ideally bring a buddy with you.\nAcademic dishonesty, including but not limited to cheating, plagiarism, or turning in someone else’s work as your own will not be tolerated. Make sure you are properly citing the sources of ideas, figures, data, etc. in your lab reports. Plagiarism not only includes direct, word-for-word quotations without identifying it as a direct quote using quotation marks and citing the source but also paraphrasing other people’s ideas, arguments, or structure without properly acknowledging them. Learning how to properly summarize and paraphrase information from an original source is an important skill, as we generally do not use word-for-word citations in the scientific reports in the natural sciences. While it is acceptable to use AI tools (e.g. grammarly) to assist you in correcting grammar, syntax or spelling or to generate synonyms for individual sentences, you should not use large-language models (such as ChatGPT, CoPilot, Claude etc.) to generate larger sections of text for you2. If you are unsure if you are properly attributing components of your written assignments, please come talk to Dr. O’Leary. Evidence of academic dishonesty will at minimum result in a zero on that assignment along with an automatic notification of the Dean.2 Given the definitions of plagiarism above consider how this can fall into both the narrow category of not attributing a direct citation. Additionally, you don’t know the extent to which the LLM is “borrowing” other peoples ideas, arguments, or structure of presenting them. As a results, you would not be properly attributing content and ideas to those sources."

You will use your spray bottle to simulate rainfall and to test how differences in landscape features form watersheds and drainage divides.\nCrumble several pieces of newspaper into balls and/or create stacks of newspaper pieces and place them in your roasting pan. Use the masking tape to fix them in place. Cut open the trash bag and flatten out any wrinkles. Raise one side of your tray (e.g. with a big text book). Finally, cover the entire pan and its content with the plastic sheet - don’t worry if you have some excess material outside of your tray.\nCongratulations - you’ve just built your first watershed!

This semester we will study streams and rivers in the Merrimack watershed. The goal is to develop skills exploring maps, and to practice exploring questions in a less structured, investigative way.\nYou can access the Stroud Water Research Center: Model my Watershed tool using this link or as posted on Canvas.\nThink of the watershed as nested basins, where smaller sub-watersheds are contained within larger ones. Here are the streams and tributaries we will re-visit throughout the semester.\n\nSchoolhouse Brook is a headwater stream (1st order) that flows into Rand Brook, near the Crossing of Cressy Hill Road and Russel Station Road, Francestown (42.958314, -71.790332)\nRand Brook is a second order stream that flows ito the South Branch Piscataquog River near Russell Station Road/2nd Turnpike South (42.958892, -71.778077)\nSouth Branch Piscataquog River meets the Middle Branch Piscataquog River at Gregg Mill Rd and Rt-13 in New Boston and flow into the Piscataquog right before Goffstown\nThe Piscataquog River flows into the Merrimack at Manchester.\nThe Merrimack River flows into the Atlantic Ocean at Newport.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive it a try\n\n\n\nOnce you have been shown how to use the mapping tool to delineate a watershed, pick three levels at which you want to compare drainage basins. Explore key characteristics and discuss your findings with your lab group (ProTip: Form an alliance with another lab group so you can have several laptops open with watersheds at different scales.)\nYou will want to trace the entire path from Schoolhouse Brook to the Merrimack at Manchester and from there two Newport to get a broad overview. You can either start at Newport and move through increasingly smaller tributaries or follow the track of a rain drop.\nRemember that you can manipulate the layers being shown on your map using the Layers box: * Streams: Continental US Medium Resolution Stream Network is probably most appropriate * You can use the different Coverage Grids to explore change in land use and examine how terrain and einvrionmental conditions vary across the watershed: You can choose from different time points to look at Land Use/Cover (click on the little i next to the layer to see a legend). You can also look at the different soil types, elevation profiles, slope and patterns of precipitation and temperature * Basemaps: Topography and Satellite imagery will be most useful and give you complementary perspectives.\nRemember that you can always zoom out to a continental level view of North America to compare our watershed to the rest of the country to determine if the patterns you are seeing are typical for a region/the country.\nWhen you have delineated a watershed you can use the Analyze Tab to explore information on streams, land use, soil, terrain, climate, point sources, and estimated numbers of farm animals. Explore how these features change at different scale. Consider differences between order of magnitude (a larger watershed will have more streams) vs different patterns (do the distribution of stream order change?).\nIdentify two key take-aways from your explorations that you find particularly interesting."

    "text": "3.2 The Water Cycle connects reservoirs of water in different spheres through specific processes\nWater is constantly moving through Earth’s systems, stored in reservoirs and transferred by processes. Most of Earth’s water is in long-term reservoirs like the oceans and glaciers, but small amounts in short-term reservoirs like the atmosphere or rivers drive many critical climate and ecological processes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider this\n\n\n\nDiscuss with your partner how you think water is distributed among different reservoirs in our earth-climate system.\nFill in the blanks below using the approximate % of total water stored in each reservoir:\nOceans: ______ %\nIce caps & glaciers: ______ %\nGroundwater: ______ %\nLakes, rivers, and wetlands: ______ %\nSoil moisture: ______ %\nAtmosphere: ______ %\nLiving organisms: ______ %\nCircle the reservoirs you think are long-term (water remains there for hundreds to thousands of years) and put a star next to the short-term reservoirs (water cycles through in days to weeks).\nWhat do you notice about the relative sizes of long- vs. short-term reservoirs?\n\n\nWater moves between reservoirs through processes. A process is any physical or biological mechanism that transfers water from one reservoir to another. Examples include:\n\nEvaporation – liquid water to water vapor.\nTranspiration – release of water vapor from plants.\nCondensation – vapor to liquid droplets (clouds).\nPrecipitation – rain, snow, sleet, hail falling from the atmosphere.\nInfiltration – water soaking into soils/groundwater.\nRunoff – water moving across the land surface into streams and rivers.\nMelting & Freezing – solid ↔︎ liquid transitions in ice and snow.\nSublimation & Deposition – solid ↔︎ vapor transitions in ice and snow.\n\nTogether, reservoirs and processes form a dynamic cycle where water continuously moves, storing and exchanging mass among Earth’s spheres (hydrosphere, cryosphere, atmosphere, biosphere, lithosphere).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider this\n\n\n\nPick two processes and describe them in your own words, include information about which reservoirs are connected and which sphere they are located in:\n\n\n\n\nCompare your description with your lab partner.\nTake another look at the list of processes and identify processes that directly involve the biosphere.\n\n\nBiogeochemical cycles are the natural movement and transformation of essential chemical elements including carbon, nitrogen, phosporous, and water through the biosphere (“bio”), and the non-living environment (“geo”) and the chemical processes that connect them. We will discuss other examples in more detail during the semester.\nAn easy way to think about these cycles is as reservoirs that are connected by specific processes. Reservoirs can be long- or short-term storage, and it is also important to consider whether reservoirs are bioavailable (chemicals are in a form that can be used by organisms) or not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive it a try\n\n\n\nOn the blank space below, create a schematic of the water cycle. Label and annotate the key reservoirs you include as well as the processes that connect them.\nChecklist for your diagram:\n\nInclude at least five reservoirs (label them clearly).\nConnect reservoirs with arrows and label the arrows with the process names.\nMark reservoirs as long-term or short-term.\nShow how multiple Earth spheres are represented (hydrosphere, cryosphere, atmosphere, biosphere, lithosphere) using labels and annotations.\nAdd at least one example of human influence (e.g., dam, irrigation, fossil fuel combustion, land use change).\n\nDiscuss with your lab partner why the water cycle is a good example of how the Earth’s spheres are interconnected (think back to our definition that the spheres are “open systems” with the freedom to exchange matter, energy, and mass).

    "text": "3.3 Exploring streamflow using the scientific Process\n\n3.3.1 Science is a verb\nAll forms of science share a common goal - to know more and better understand how the world operates. For scientific inquiry we typically employ two types of logical thinking inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning. Inductive reasoning moves from the particular to the general, by contrast, deductive reasoning moves from the general to the particular.\nFor descriptive science our goal is to observe, explore, and discover. Here, we typically employ inductive reasoning with the goal of developing a hypothesis or theory. To do this, we compile related observation to draw general conclusions. We make observations and record them to build large data sets that allow us to infer generalizations based on an analysis. The data sets can be qualitative or quantitative and are frequently supplemented with drawings, pictures/videos. By contrast, hypothesis-driven science begins with a specific question/problem and a proposed testable or answer/solution. In this case, we are using deductive reasoning to test a theory: We start with a general principle and use that to predict a specific outcome assuming it is true and we design an experiment to determine if our results support the hypothesis. Even though we have just described these two types of reasoning as a binary to understand the difference between the approaches, most scientific studies rely on both approaches.\nWe frequently differentiate between basic and applied science. While basic science (frequently also referred to as fundamental or pure science) sees to gain fundamental knowledge and understanding of natural phenomena for its own sake, applied sciences uses that basic knowledge to solve specific, practical problems and develop new technologies, products or interventions.\nToday we are going to familiarize ourselves with all these different aspects of the scientific process by exploring patterns of stream flow and precipitation.\nHydrologists use stream gauges to measure discharge (the volume of water flowing past a point in a river per unit time). These data provide critical insight into the functioning of watersheds, seasonal water availability, and responses to precipitation. You will use USGS stream gauge data to visualize flow patterns and, at the same time, learn how scientists frame questions and test ideas.\nScience often begins with description — identifying what patterns exist before asking why. This is especially common in the environmental sciences were long-term monitoring plays a central role.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive it a try\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with USGS streamflow data (daily mean discharge) and paired precipitation data for one stream gauge.\nAs part of your ditigal literacy assignment you should have created a folder for all your lab files called LB106. In that folder create a subfolder called 02_streamflow with subfolders for data and results.\nDownload the USGS stream gauge data and paired precipitation data for the Piscataquog USGS gauge located near at Howe Bridge in New Boston, as well as two locations on the Merrimack.\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Exploratory analysis & visualizations (Descriptive Science)\nOnce you have downloaded the data follow your instructors cues to learn how to use a spreadsheet program like Excel to create simple visualizations.\nFor our first set of plots, we are using what is called a time series and our data represents continuous data.\n\nWe will visualize stream discharge over one year using a line plot.\nWe will use a barplot to visualize mean monthly discharge.\n\nThen we will compare two continuous variable, precipitation and discharge, which is typically done using a scatter plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider this\n\n\n\nDiscuss your results with your lab partner.\nA good rule of thumb for a description of results is to start with the general trend and to then describe notable highlights. Be sure to use terms like “higher”, “lower”, “similar” etc to contextualize your results but the actual numbers are just as important especially if somebody wants to compare their results to yours. For example it is important to now that e.g. “there was more rain in December” but to compare that to another location we would want not only want to know the trend but also how much rain there was.\nHere are a few things to look for:\n\nWhat patterns do you see in the data over the year? e.g. seasonal trends, peaks after storms\nWhich months are the highest/lowest? Are there environmental patterns that might explain this?\nDo higher precipitation events always lead to higher discharge? Is there a lag?\n\nDescribe your results for each figure (at this point, only describe, don’t interpret your results).\n\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Moving toward explanation (hypothesis-driven science)\nAfter describing patterns, scientists often propose explanations and test them. A handy way to develop a hypothesis is to use the If…then…because format. The if-then component is a prediction you are making - the because component is the actual hypothesis where you propose a mechanisms that is at play. Remember, a good hypothesis should be testable and falsifiable. You also should always double check whether you have the data to test your hypothesis or you can design an experiment to generate the data you need.\nExamples:\n\nIf precipitation increases, then streamflow will rise within one day because rainfall quickly runs off the surface.\nIf winter temperatures are above freezing, then discharge will increase because snow and ice are melting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive it a try\n\n\n\nWork with your partner to generate 3-5 hypothesis in the if-then-because format that we can test with the data at hand.\nDescribe how you will use the data to test your hypothesis (what will your figure look like) and then create a sketch of what your figure will look like if you are correct.\n\n\nWe will compare our hypothesis with the class and pick the one(s) we want to test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive it a try\n\n\n\n(Re)state the hypothesis you are testing and plot your data.\nDescribe your results and determine whether you were correct - this means that you are interpreting your data. You are not only describing what you “saw”, you are actively trying to explain why you are seeing this patterns. Your first step is to compare it your hypothesis and prediction - does it match? That is evidence that your hypothesis is not wrong. It doesn’t match? Well, now we have some explaining to do.\nA handy format to describe your findings is the following scaffold:\n\nIn this study, I investigated [broad question asked/hypothesis tested]. To achieve this, I [specific data set + analysis used]. I found that [key results] which [statement about how this does or does not support your hypothesis].\n\n\n\nEnvironmental Science incorporates both basic and applied science. For example, basic science would look to understand watershed processes, while applied scientists would use that understanding to improve flood prediction or water management.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider this\n\n\n\nReflect and restate what you learned about the scientific process.\n\nDefine what inductive reasoning is and what deductive reasoning is.\nUse your definitions to argue which of these examples falls into which category.\n\nYou see that discharge peaks after every rainstorm and conclude that precipitation drives streamflow.\nYou hypothesize that precipitation will cause an immediate increase in discharge and generate several scatter plots from different locations to determine if this principle holds.\n\nDefine what descriptive and hypothesis driven research is.\nThink back over your work today and categorize it as descriptive or hypothesis-driven research.\nCompare and contrast basic and applied science.\nIdentify one way your work today could be considered basic science and one way to could be considered applied science."

These gauges measure stage (the height of water in a river or stream). Using a rating curve (an empirical relationship between stage and discharge), hydrologists convert stage into streamflow (volume of water per time).\nTypes of gauges include:\n\nStaff gauges – simple rulers mounted in streams to visually read stage.\nPressure transducers – measure water pressure to determine depth.\nRadar or acoustic sensors – mounted above the water to measure surface height.\n\nTogether, these tools help build hydrological regimes — descriptions of how streamflow changes over days, seasons, and years, including responses to storms, snow melt, and drought.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider this\n\n\n\nSmall streams such as headwater streams are especially difficult to monitor.\nDiscuss with your partner\n\nWhat factors might make it difficult to monitor headwater streams?\nWhy is it especially important to understand the hydrological regimes of headwater streams in the context of climate change and land-use impacts?\n\n\n\nA lower-cost, more flexible approach is to use wildlife cameras or other time-lapse photography systems to monitor small streams.\nHow it works:\n\nCameras are positioned to capture images of the stream channel over time.\nTraining data is created by annotating images (e.g., marking “flowing” vs. “dry,” or “low flow,” “medium flow,” “high flow”).\nAn AI/ML model is trained on these annotated images to learn patterns that correlate with streamflow.\n\nOnce trained, the model can predict flow conditions from new images, producing a hydrograph similar to one from a traditional gauge.\nCritical considerations:\n\nCamera positioning: Must clearly capture the water surface. Poor angles, glare, or obstruction can reduce accuracy.\nEnvironmental challenges: Snow, ice, vegetation growth, drought, or debris can complicate predictions.\nBaseline quality: Models are only as good as the annotated images used to train them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive it a try\n\n\n\nBefore lab this week you should have requested access to USGS’ Flow Photo explorer.

This is frequently referred to as a research compendium.\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate sub folders by right clicking and selecting new folder. ProTip: keep everything lowercase so later you don’t have to remember what/if you capitalized.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the streamflow lab we have daily discharge and precipitation for the last year as well as mean monthly discharge and historical monthly discharge going back &gt; 50 years for three locations. All 9 files are in our data folder in separate spreadsheets.\n\n\n\n\n8.1.2 Set up a new plot\n\n\n\nOpen a spreadsheet with data in it, in this example we have columns with the weather station ID, the name of the weather station, the date, precipitation data, discharge and the USGS station name. Make sure that you know what columns contain the data you want to plot.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse Insert Chart to insert a blank chart into your spreadsheet.\n\n\n\n\n\nDouble click the chart area to pull up the Chart editor on the right hand of your screen. Open the Chart Type dropdown menu. We will most typically use line charts for time series, column (bar charts) to visualize categorical data, and scatterplots to show relationships between two continuous variables.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this example we will select a line chart. Next we need to pick our data range. The easiest way to do this to click on the little grid in the Data Range selector. You can either use your cursor to select the data range or simply chose the suggested data range (remember to double check! this works well if you don’t have a lot of missing data where it is easy for the program to determine where the data block is).\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect the data range and click OK\n\n\n\n\n\nNow you should see that GoogleSheets is using the column headers to allow you to more easily select entire columns than having to drag a cursor across your columns. We need to make sure we have the correct set rather than the default.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor our example we want to select the date column for our x-axis. You can do this using the drop down menu.\n\n\n\n\n\nnext we will set up our y-axis - you can use the hamburger/three drot menu to remove unwanted variables.\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect discharge as the series to be displayed.\n\n\n\n\n8.1.3 Format axis and chart titles\n\n\n\nA good figure has clearly labeled axis. You can add and edit titles using the Customize menu/tab. Go ahead and switch to that view.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the drop down menu to select the horizontal axis title.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a horizontal axis to get your x-axis title.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd a vertical axis for your y-axis title. Good practice is including the variable being displayed along with the units it is measured in.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can also add a chart title. This is important if your figures are going to be standalone, i.e. they are not going to be added into a document where they would have a figure legend under the figure that would include a title and description.\n\n\n\n\n8.1.4 Exporting figures and inserting them into documents\n\n\n\nYou can use the hamburger/three dot menu to download the chart. Downloading it as a PNG to easily be able to insert it into another document (this is not an option for a pdf). An svg means that you would be able to edit it in a program link Inkscape or Illustrator. Remember that results folder we made? That is where it should go. If you are going to keep working with GoogleDocs you can also select to Copy the chart.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen a GoogleDoc. A right click will bring up a menu to allow you to Paste your figure. Alternatively you could use the shortcut Ctrl + V (or Command + V).\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure that you select paste unlinked to make sure that it is standalone and no longer connected to your spreadsheet and any changes you might make there.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoom - Figure!

    "text": "6.1 Scientific inquiry\n“Science” can be define as a systematic, evidence-based approach to understanding the natural world1. It comprises both the body of existing knowledge and is a process of inquiry with the goal of understanding, explaining, and predicting natural phenomena. Science relies on observations, empirical2 evidence, experimentation, and the formulation of hypothesis and theories to describe the underlying principles that govern the natural world. Scientific knowledge is provisional and subject to revision as new data and evidence become available which necessitate modifying or replacing scientific theories.1 We frequently use the term natural sciences to refer to fields of science specifically centered around the physical world and the phenomena and processes that govern it, which typically refers to broadly to life sciences/biology, chemistry, physics, geology, though not everyone is in agreement in what to include. Frankly, depending on the type of research questions somebody is interested in. For example, a psychologist might consider themselves a natural scientist compared to a social scientist.2 Empirical in contrast to theory is based on verifiable observation/experiences.\nAll forms of science share a common goal - to know more and better understand how the world operates. For scientific inquiry we typically employ two types of logical thinking inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning3. For descriptive science our goal is to observe, explore, and discover. Here, we typically employ inductive reasoning with the goal of developing a hypothesis or theory. To do this, we compile related observation to draw general conclusions. We make observations and record them4 to build large data sets that allow us to infer generalizations based on an analysis. By contrast, hypothesis-driven science begins with a specific question/problem and a proposed testable or answer/solution. In this case, we are using deductive reasoning to test a theory: We start with a general principle and use that to predict a specific outcome assuming it is true and we design an experiment to determine if our results support the hypothesis. Even though we have just described these two types of reasoning as a binary to understand the difference between the approaches, most scientific studies rely on both approaches.3 Inductive reasoning moves from the particular to the general. Deductive reasoning moves from the general to the particular.4 The data sets can be qualitative or quantitative and are frequently supplemented with drawings, pictures/videos."

    "section": "6.2 The Scientific method",
    "text": "6.2 The Scientific method\nThe scientific method is a key process that guides the process of scientific inquiry with the goal of advancing knowledge. It follows a structured process of formulating hypotheses based on observations, designing repeatable5 experiments, collecting data, and drawing conclusions based on evidence.5 In the natural sciences, the scientific method centered around repeatable experiments is arguably the key process. However, for example in paleontology repeatable experiments are not possible. Still, they follow the same process formulating a hypothesis that may be supported or contradicted by new findings\nGenerally the scientific method starts with an Observation. For example, you might notice that on a specific island birds there is a large number of birds nest on the ground. Observations can also include your own or other scientists previous research. So rather than have visited the island yourself, you may have read about it in the literature.\nThe next step is to ask a Research Question based on these observations. Research questions can be descriptive or causal. A descriptive question quantifies an observation and seeks to identify trends and patterns. In this case we might ask, “What proportion of individuals are building their nests on the ground?” or “Are all species building their nests on the ground?”. By contrast, a causal question focuses on understanding why we observe trends and patterns. In our example, we would likely ask “Why are birds building their nests on the ground?”. Frequently, a descriptive question leads to a causal one because once we have an idea of what the trends and patterns are we want to know why we are observing them. So for example, if we had pursued our initial question we may have determine that “90% of nests are built on the ground” or “Species X always builds their nests on the ground.” and we may formulate a more specific question such as “Why does species X build their nests on the ground and species Y does not?”. In our course, as the instructor, I am frequently pointing you towards observations and “big research questions” and then instructing you to develop a more specific question that we can answer within the confines of our lab.\nNext, we need to formulate a Hypothesis as a proposed answer to the research question based on prior knowledge. Rationale for hypothesis should be supported by previous research and understanding of an area of research. In this case, as ecologists, we might have read about other examples of ground nest-building or the prevalence of flightless birds in the absence of predators and so we hypothesize that in this case the island might lack predators for species X but there are predators present for species Y. A hypothesis must be both testable and falsifiable. Testable means that we can generate predictions and use observation and experimentation to determine if they are correct. Falsifiable means that we must be able to design experiments so results can disprove the hypothesis.\nOur next step is to make a Prediction that describes the expected observed outcome assuming our hypothesis is true. Prediction and hypothesis are distinct from each other, even though they are frequently used interchangeable. A prediction is frequently formulated as a If-Then statement. In our example, we might predict that for each species on islands where predators co-occur we observe a small number of birds nests on the ground and on islands where there are no or few predators that number would be larger. Remember that your hypothesis adds a “because” component to your prediction - this is your understanding of what mechanism might cause that predicted relationship or effect to occur. In our course, we are typically combining the prediction and hypothesis using the “if-then-because” structure to develop a hypothesis.\nFinally, we design and execute an experiment or study to test our prediction. In this case, we would need to identify a series of islands inhabited by the bird species that vary in their level of predator prevalence and quantify the proportion of nests built on the ground. Then we would determine if our results are consistent with our prediction or not.\nGenerally, once we have the answer, we find that we have more questions and we iterate where our results and conclusion become the next set of observations that start the process over again."

    "section": "6.3 Designing Controlled Experiments",
    "text": "6.3 Designing Controlled Experiments\nThe scientific method hinges on robustly designed experiments. The goal of an experiment is to systematically test a hypothesis, Therefore, we must pay careful attention to ensure our design enables this. In a controlled experiment, the we manipulates one or more independent variables to observe the effect on a dependent variable while carefully controlling other relevant variables to ensure consistent conditions across treatments. As a result, we are (hopefully) able to establish cause-and-effect relationships, with a high level of certainty based on our results.\nHere are the key steps to Experimental Design:\n\nIdentify the dependent and independent variables you are interested in and how they are related.\nDetermine how you will measure your dependent variable.\nFormulate a testable, falsifiable hypothesis and predict the outcome.\nDesign experimental treatments that manipulate your independent variable.\nIdentify variables that you need to control for and modify your design to accommodate this.\nFinalize aspects like sample size, replicates, and randomization.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nEven though we are presenting these as consecutive steps, the process of designing a experiment is frequently iterative where you need to go back and make adjustments or you may be considering components of the experimental design at the same time before making final decisions to ensure a good design.\n\n\nLet’s think through the nuances of experimental design using another example.\nYou make the observation, that when you plant onions, garlic, leeks, or chives on the perimeter of your garden, you lettuce is less affected by slugs. You initially as a descriptive research question: “Do onions, garlic, leeks, or chives reduce the impact of slugs?”. Next, you formulated the hypothesis “Onions, garlic, leeks, or chives repel slugs.” and test this by collecting data from a range of gardens that did or did not have onions, garlic, leeks, or chives planted on the perimeter and you found that indeed the “slug-affectedness” is significantly lower. Based on this new observation you are ready to pose a causal research question: “Why do onions, garlic, leeks, or chives repell slugs?”. Before your formulate your research hypothesis you do some additional research and learn that these plants are all part of the Allium family which produce allicin which is toxic to a range of organisms, including slugs. This leads you to postulate a research hypothesis: “Allicin is toxic to slugs and as a result allicin-producing plants repel slugs.”.\nNow, you are ready to design an experiment.\nFirst, we need to figure out what variables we are are in play and how they relate to each other.\nGenerally, we categorize variables as either independent, dependent, or controlled variables. The dependent or response variable is the variable you expect to be affected and are therefore measuring in your experiment6. By contrast, the independent or explanatory variable is the variable or phenomena that you think will affect your dependent variable7. Any remaining variables are what we would consider constants or controlled variables. These are factors that we will want to intentionally keep constant so they do not effect the outcome.6 It is not uncommon to measure more than one dependent variable in an experiment. Frequently you will measure the outcome in more than one way.7 Having only one independent variable makes the interpretation of the an experiment straightforward. However, including two or more independent variables allows us to test not only the effect of each explanatory variable but also how they interact, i.e. how they modify each other’s effects.\nLet’s think about our example to identify what variables are involved and what their relationship is. In this case, we think that the outcome will differ depending whether allicin is present or not. That makes “allicin presence” our explanatory or independent variable. By contrast, the outcome that we think will change is “slug presence” or “slug impact”, which makes that our response or dependent variable.\nBefore we move on to the next step, we will want to figure out how we are going to quantify our dependent variable.\nFrequently this requires having a rough idea of what your experimental design will look like. Let’s say that we are going to have a set up with multiple plots and plants that slugs like to eat. We could directly measure whether or not slugs are present, for example by counting the number of slugs in a specific parameter or we could indirectly measure whether allicin repels slugs by determine the level of impact by assessing the damage to the plants. We could quantify this by counting the number of affected plants or by creating a scale of how strongly a plant is impacted e.g. based on the amount that was eaten. Which is our best option? Well, there might not actually be a “best” option because each gives us an different line of evidence, in that case we might decide to include all three dependent variables: Number of observed slugs beyond an allicin barrier, number of plants affected, and level of plants affected.\nNow we are ready to formulate a hypothesis.\nWe should conceptually differ between a Biological, Scientific or Research Hypothesis as an idea or claim about one specific or very narrow set of natural phenomena, in contrast to a Statistical Hypothesis, that is specific to our experimental design. We generally design an study comprising of one or multiple experiments to test the research hypothesis we developed based on a set of observations. However, when we plan that experiment we make specific choices about the variables we are using and for our data analysis we need to define statistical hypothesis that allow us to make predictions specifically about our outcome or dependent variable and test those mathematically. This will always have two parts: A Null hypothesis \\(H_{O}\\) that states that there is no relationship or pattern between the independent and the dependent variables and an Alternative hypothesis \\(H_{a}\\) which stats that there is a relationship or pattern between the independent and dependent variable.\nLet’s apply this to our example:\nOur Biological hypothesis is “Allicin repels slugs because it is toxic to them”. Now that we have identified our variables and how we are going to measure them, we can restate this as a statistical hypothesis and make predictions regarding the outcome of our experiment.\nWe can state our Null hypothesis \\(H_{O}\\) as “The presence of allicin does not affect the presence of slugs” and then make a set of predictions assuming this is true:\n\nThe number observed slugs will be the same both when plants are or are not protected by an allicin border.\nThe number of impacted plants will be the same both when plants are or are not protected by allicin border.\nThe level to which plants are impacted will be the same both when plants are or are not protected by allicin border.\n\nWe also need to formulate our Alternative hypothesis \\(H_{a}\\) as “The presence of allicin impacts the presence of slugs.” and then make a series of predictions assuming this true.\n\nThe number observed slugs will be lower when plants are protected by an allicin border.\nThe number of affected plants will be lower when plants are protected by an allicin border.\nThe level to which plants are impacted will be lower when plants are protected by an allicin border.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe fact that we were able to state both a null and alternative hypothesis ensures that our hypothesis is falsifiable.\n\n\nOur next step is to design an experiment that tests our statistical hypothesis.\nOur experiment should include at least two groups or treatments8, the control and the experimental groups. The groups should be completely the same, with the exception that an experimental group receives a treatment while the control does not. Comparing these two groups allows us to determine if the treatment has had an effect. You should always include a control group to have a baseline of what the outcome should look like if there is no effect (negative control) or if there is an effect (positive control)9. Depending on the complexity of your hypothesis and the number of dependent and independent variables you are testing, your design may comprise several experimental groups, each with a different treatment.8 We use the term treatment to describe a set of conditions.9 It’s important to keep in mind that positive and negative have nothing to do with “good” or “bad” in this context but rather presence/absence of an effect.\nLet’s think about our example. It’s always important to consider what you are trying to test to figure out how to design the experiment. For example, we would not want a set up where we have a number of slugs and we expose them to Allicin to determine if it kills them or makes them sick - We already know that Allicin is toxic to slugs. We want to know whether the presence of Allicin repels slugs, i.e. if they get close to something that is emiting Allicin (e.g. onions), can they sense that from a “safe distance” and stay clear.\nLet’s assume that we have an outdoor space in which we can plant multiple small plots. Our independent variable is “Allicin presence” so we would need to create treatments that differ in whether or not Allicin is present. We can’t do this by planting onions or leeks - because then we still wouldn’t know if it is the Allicin or something else in the Allium plants that is repeling the slugs. So we need to have isolated Allicin, perhaps diluted in water that would allow us to spray a border either around the entire experimental plot. We would want to do some research to figure out what concentrations would be comparable to onions or similar being present. Then as our control, we would have plots without a Allicin border.\nWith our treatments in place, we need to identify variables that we need to control for to ensure that if we do see a difference between our experimental and control treatments we can ensure that they are due to the independent variable.\nFor our example, if we are outdoors we have a wide range of variables like sunlight/shade, soil conditions, temperature, and other weather conditions to consider. Those are variables that we cannot control, however, ideally we can chose our plot locations so we can reasonably assume that they are consistent across treatments. In addition, we would want to make sure that we are running our experiment during a time of year where it e.g. isn’t too cold for slugs to be out and about. Better yet, we might see if we cannot get access to a greenhouse where we can control these conditions.\nIdeally, we would also control the number of slugs. This might require hiring a bunch of 5-year olds to go slug collecting and then we could “seed” the number of slugs around each plot. Again, this might be easier to do in a greenhouse.\nThe type of plant being grown and potentially snacked on by slugs is also a variable that we probably want to control. The most straightforward set up would be to identify a plant that we know slugs like to eat10 and then have each plot be set up in an identical way.10 This is important because otherwise we don’t know whether there was no slug damage/presence because of that plant itself or the Allicin treatment.\nAs a final step, we need to account for sample size, replicates, randomization to ensure that our results are reliable and representative.\nA key component of experimental design is ensuring the sample size is sufficiently large that we can be confident that our results can be generalized to the population as a whole. There is always potential for naturally occurring variation despite our best efforts to control all the variables that we are not testing for. For example some of our slugs might just be lazy. So we would want to have a sufficiently large sample size of slugs to ensure that we can account for this. Similarly, we would want to make sure that we include a a consistent number of plants in each plot and ensure that that number is large enough to account for variability.\nWe would also want to decide if we want to have just one control and one experimental treatment or whether it makes more sense to have replicates, i.e. we set up multiple plots for each type of treatment. That way if there was e.g. variability in the soil that meant that the Allicin was absorbed/dispersed differently that variability would have less of an effect when we combine results across plots in the same treatment category.\nLet’s say that we decide to have three control and three experimental treatments, then we would need to consider how we want them laid out in our greenhouse or outdoor space. You could have all of the control plots on one side and all of the experimental plots on the other. But what if the greenhouse is warmer on one side compared to the other? This could affect the activity of the slugs. In this case we would want to randomize the placement of our plots to minimize those impacts. Another aspect of randomization would be that if we had for example collected our slugs from several different locations we would want to randomly assign those to different plots.\nAt this point, we have thought through all the important aspects of our experimental design that we have though through to optimize our experimental design and ensure all of these aspects are accounted for.\n\nDoes my design allow me to systematically and precisely manipulate the independent variable(s)?\nAm I able to precisely measure the dependent variably?\nHave I made sure to control any confounding variables?"

    "text": "6.4 Conducting Field and Observational Experiments\nIn many biological fields, including ecology and evolution, we more commonly use observational experiments or studies compare to the controlled design. Here, we observe and record natural phenomena without manipulating any variables. The studies are still carefully designed and follow the scientific method. However, in a controlled experiment we are able to effectively isolate the effect of the independent variable from other factors because we are able to include both an experimental group that is exposed to the treatment and a control group that is not, while controlling all other variables. By contrast, in an observational experiment we generally cannot intervene to control or change the conditions to create a control group because it is impractical, impossible or frankly, unethical to manipulate variables directly11. Our first example exploring the relationship of bird nests and predator presence would likely fall into this category. Observational experiments give us important insights into existing patterns and relationships in the natural environment and how phenomena play out in the real world. However, results are frequently a bit messier or more ambiguous and it is more difficult to establish causality because a lack of experimental control means that there are more challenges due to the presence of confounding variables and difficulties isolating just one independent variable to test for.11 Sometimes you will hear somebody describe certain field experiments as a “natural laboratory” because there is a naturally occurring situation that mimics how we would design a controlled experiments. For example, islands or lakes can create scenarios where e.g. predators are only present in one location and so it functions as a “natural control group”. However, even then it is not possible to match all variables e.g. temperature or other abiotic factors the way we can in a controlled setting."

    "section": "4.2 Introduction",
    "text": "4.2 Introduction\n\n4.2.1 Assessing water quality with physical and chemical parameters\nWater quality assessment is essential for understanding the health of freshwater ecosystems and for protecting the services they provide to people and nature. Environmental scientists evaluate water quality by measuring a suite of physical, chemical, and biological parameters that together reflect the condition of rivers, lakes, and groundwater. Agencies such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and state departments of environmental services monitor water quality routinely to track compliance with the Clean Water Act, identify impairments, and assess suitability for drinking water, recreation, aquatic life, and other designated uses. Data from these monitoring programs provide baselines for evaluating changes over time, detecting pollution sources, and guiding restoration and management decisions. In this lab, you will use field-collected samples to measure key parameters with widely implemented test kits, building hands-on experience with the same indicators used by agencies and researchers.\nIn this lab we will consider four main groups of water quality parameters.\nPhysical/environmental parameters:\n\nTemperature (°C) regulates biological activity, metabolic rates, and oxygen solubility.\nDissolved oxygen (mg/L) is essential for aquatic organisms. Values below ~5 mg/L stress sensitive species, while levels below 2 mg/L can create hypoxic “dead zones”.\nOxidation–reduction potential (ORP, mV) reflects the overall redox state of the water and can indicate conditions favorable to oxidation or reduction reactions.\nTurbidity (NTU) and total dissolved solids (TDS, mg/L) measure water clarity and the total load of dissolved material, respectively; high values may indicate erosion, road salt, or wastewater inputs.\n\nChemical parameters:\n\npH (unitless) reflects acidity/alkalinity; natural waters generally range between 6.5–8.5, and deviations can harm aquatic life.\nConductivity or specific conductance (µS/cm) is a measure of ionic strength; high values can indicate salts, fertilizers, or urban runoff.\nSalinity (ppt) is closely related to conductivity and becomes important in tidal reaches.\nTotal hardness (mg/L as CaCO₃) represents the concentration of calcium and magnesium ions. Hardness affects buffering capacity and the solubility of other chemicals; very soft water (&lt;60 mg/L as CaCO₃) is more vulnerable to acidification, while very hard water (&gt;180 mg/L) may indicate carbonate-rich geology or anthropogenic inputs.\n\nNutrient parameters:\n\nNitrate (mg/L as N), ammonium (mg/L as N), and phosphate (mg/L as P) are key nutrients that support primary production. At low levels, they are essential to ecosystem function, but elevated concentrations often stem from fertilizer runoff, wastewater, or septic leachate, and can lead to eutrophication, algal blooms, and oxygen depletion.\nChloride (mg/L) is often associated with road de-icing salts; concentrations above ~230 mg/L are concerning for chronic exposure in freshwater ecosystems.\n\nTogether, these parameters provide a multi-dimensional picture of river health, integrating natural watershed characteristics with human influences such as urbanization, agriculture, and wastewater discharge. Very high or very low values in any parameter may serve as “red flags” of disturbance, pollution, or altered ecosystem function. By exploring these data across a connected watershed—the South Branch Piscataquog and Merrimack Rivers—you will develop broad questions about how water quality changes downstream and form specific hypotheses about the drivers shaping observed patterns.\n\n\n4.2.2 Temperature and Dissolved Oxygen shape biological communities\nTemperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) are two of the most important factors shaping the biological community in streams and rivers. Many aquatic organisms, especially fish and macroinvertebrates, have narrow temperature tolerances. Coldwater species such as brook trout require cool, oxygen-rich water and often move into shaded headwater streams or groundwater-fed tributaries during the summer to avoid thermal stress. Excellent conditions for even the most sensitive species generally mean dissolved oxygen concentrations above 7–8 mg/L, with brook trout and other salmonids thriving best when levels exceed 9 mg/L. Dissolved oxygen (DO) levels are closely tied to temperature, since cooler water can hold more oxygen than warmer water. DO is also influenced by flow conditions (turbulent riffles increase oxygen exchange), photosynthesis by aquatic plants and algae (which elevates DO during the day but can reduce it at night), and the decomposition of organic matter (which consumes oxygen). Anthropogenic factors such as nutrient enrichment (leading to algal blooms and nighttime oxygen crashes), wastewater inputs, stormwater runoff, and channel modifications that reduce flow turbulence can all lower DO. Along a watershed, DO patterns are expected to change: small, shaded, fast-flowing headwaters often have cool water with consistently high oxygen; mid-sized rivers may show greater variability with warmer water and diel fluctuations in DO; and in the larger, slower mainstem reaches approaching the ocean, DO levels often decline due to higher temperatures, deeper channels, and organic matter accumulation, though tidal mixing in estuarine zones can reintroduce oxygen. Maintaining cool headwaters and high DO levels is therefore critical to sustaining diverse and healthy stream ecosystems.\n\n\n4.2.3 Turbidity measures suspended particles\nTurbidity is a measure of how cloudy or opaque water appears due to suspended particles such as sediment, organic matter, algae, and pollutants. It is usually measured in nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) using a sensor that detects how light scatters when it passes through the water. Turbidity is an important parameter for assessing watershed health because high levels can reduce light penetration, limiting photosynthesis in aquatic plants, clog fish gills, smother benthic habitats, and transport contaminants bound to sediments. In a healthy watershed, turbidity levels are typically below 10 NTU, though brief increases after storm events are normal; values consistently above 50–100 NTU may indicate ecosystem stress or poor water quality. Along a river continuum, turbidity often starts low in headwater streams where water is fast-moving and filtered by forest soils, gradually increases in the main stem as tributaries contribute sediments and nutrients, and may peak near the outlet where larger flows, floodplains, and human activity accumulate impacts. Anthropogenic factors such as deforestation, agriculture, construction, mining, and urban runoff can greatly elevate turbidity by increasing erosion and sediment delivery. However, not all turbidity is a sign of an unhealthy system: natural events such as heavy rains, snowmelt, or seasonal algal blooms can temporarily raise turbidity levels without long-term harm. Understanding both the magnitude and duration of turbidity fluctuations is therefore essential for interpreting ecosystem health.\nTurbidity is not just about water clarity—it is also a key driver of nutrient transport and availability, and must be considered alongside nitrogen and phosphorus measurements to understand watershed health. Turbidity and nutrients are tightly connected in streams and rivers because suspended particles often act as carriers for nutrient compounds.\n\nPhosphorus: A large fraction of phosphorus in streams is bound to sediment particles. When turbidity increases due to erosion or storm runoff, phosphorus levels often rise as well. This can fuel algal blooms downstream once particles settle and release phosphorus.\nNitrogen: Particulate organic matter suspended in turbid water can contain nitrogen that becomes available when decomposed, further contributing to nutrient enrichment.\nLight Limitation: High turbidity reduces light penetration, which can limit photosynthesis and primary productivity—even if nutrient levels are high. This means turbidity can both mask and amplify the effects of nutrient loading depending on conditions.\nAnthropogenic Drivers: Construction, agriculture, road runoff, and urbanization can simultaneously increase turbidity and nutrient input, creating a strong link between land use and water quality.\n\n\n\n4.2.4 TDS measures dissolved particles\nTotal Dissolved Solids (TDS) is a measure of the combined concentration of dissolved inorganic salts (such as calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, bicarbonates, chlorides, and sulfates) and small amounts of organic material in water. It is usually measured in parts per million (ppm) using a gravimetric method or conductivity-based sensors. TDS is an important water quality parameter because it reflects the overall ionic composition of a stream and influences aquatic life, nutrient cycling, and the suitability of water for human use. In natural systems, headwater streams typically have low TDS because they are fed by precipitation and groundwater inputs with limited mineral contact, while levels tend to increase downstream as water interacts with soils, bedrock, and tributary inputs. By the time rivers reach their main stem and outlet, TDS can be much higher, especially where geology contributes soluble minerals. Anthropogenic factors such as road salt application, agricultural runoff, industrial discharges, and wastewater inputs can cause abnormally high TDS levels, which may stress aquatic organisms, alter osmoregulation, and disrupt ecological balance. In general, TDS below 300 ppm is considered excellent, while values above 500 ppm can be concerning for sensitive species and may indicate pollution or excessive salt loading. Natural factors such as seasonal snowmelt, drought (which concentrates solutes), or volcanic/mineral springs can also elevate TDS without necessarily signifying poor ecosystem health. Because both natural and human influences shape TDS, interpreting values requires consideration of local geology, land use, and seasonal variation.\n\n\n4.2.5 ORP can be indicative of microbial activity and organic loading\nOxidation-Reduction Potential (ORP) is a measure of the tendency of water to either gain or lose electrons, reflecting its ability to act as an oxidizing or reducing environment. It is measured using an electrochemical probe that compares the potential of the water sample to a standard reference electrode, and values are reported in millivolts (mV). Positive ORP values indicate oxidizing conditions, which are generally associated with healthy, oxygen-rich environments, while negative values reflect reducing conditions, common in oxygen-depleted or anaerobic environments. Because oxygen is the strongest naturally occurring oxidizing agent in most surface waters, ORP is closely tied to dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations. In well-aerated headwater streams with high DO, ORP values are typically high (around +300 to +500 mV), supporting diverse aquatic life including sensitive species. As water moves downstream, ORP often decreases due to cumulative organic inputs, sediment oxygen demand, and nutrient enrichment, which can lower DO and drive more reducing conditions. Sustained ORP values below +100 mV often indicate low DO, high microbial respiration, or pollution, while strongly negative values (below 0 mV) may signal severe oxygen depletion or eutrophic conditions. Anthropogenic factors such as wastewater discharge, agricultural runoff, and industrial effluents can reduce ORP by consuming oxygen and fueling microbial activity. Natural processes, like organic matter breakdown in wetlands or seasonal low-flow conditions, can also reduce ORP without necessarily reflecting ecosystem collapse. In general, healthy freshwater systems maintain ORP values above +300 mV and DO above 7–8 mg/L, while persistent declines in both parameters often signal ecological stress. Monitoring ORP together with DO provides a more complete picture of oxygen dynamics, redox processes, and overall river health from pristine headwaters to developed lowland reaches and estuarine outlets.\n\n\n4.2.6 Total Hardness indicates buffering capacity, nutrient availability and affects animal’s physiology\nTotal Hardness is a measure of the concentration of multivalent cations in water, primarily calcium (Ca²⁺) and magnesium (Mg²⁺) ions, which are naturally leached from soils and bedrock. It is typically determined using a titration with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and expressed in parts per million (ppm) as calcium carbonate (CaCO₃). Hardness is an important parameter for assessing watershed health because it influences buffering capacity, nutrient availability, and the physiology of aquatic organisms. Very soft waters (&lt;60 ppm) often have limited buffering ability, making them vulnerable to acidification and harmful pH swings, while very hard waters (&gt;180 ppm) can cause scaling, alter nutrient solubility, and stress species not adapted to such conditions. In a watershed, hardness often starts relatively low in headwater streams depending on the underlying geology, and may increase downstream as water interacts with carbonate-rich soils, limestone, or anthropogenic inputs. By the time rivers reach the main stem and outlet, hardness tends to be higher due to cumulative inputs from tributaries and land use activities. Anthropogenic factors such as agricultural lime application, industrial effluents, and urban runoff (including concrete leaching and road dust) can elevate hardness beyond natural ranges. Conversely, acid rain or mining drainage can lower hardness, leaving waters poorly buffered and more vulnerable to ecological stress. Generally, hardness between 60–120 ppm is considered moderately hard and optimal for most freshwater ecosystems, while values consistently below 40 ppm or above 300 ppm may be concerning depending on the biological community. Natural factors such as seasonal flow variation or local geology (e.g., granite vs. limestone bedrock) can drive changes in hardness that do not necessarily indicate unhealthy conditions, underscoring the need to interpret this parameter in context.\nHardness is also closely linked to alkalinity—a measure of the water’s ability to neutralize acids, which is largely controlled by carbonate (CO₃²⁻) and bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) ions. Together, hardness and alkalinity influence pH buffering capacity, or the resistance of a stream to rapid pH fluctuations caused by acid rain, pollution, or biological processes like respiration and photosynthesis. Waters with sufficient hardness and alkalinity can maintain relatively stable pH levels that support a diverse aquatic community, while very soft waters are more prone to swings that can stress or eliminate sensitive species. This makes hardness an important parameter not only on its own, but also in understanding broader chemical interactions that stabilize stream ecosystems across a watershed.\n\n\n4.2.7 pH impacts chemical processes, nutrient solubility, and animal physiology\npH is a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions (H⁺) in water, expressed on a logarithmic scale ranging from 0 (acidic) to 14 (basic), with 7 being neutral. It is typically measured using either colorimetric field kits or electronic pH probes and is reported in pH units (dimensionless). pH is an important parameter for ecosystem health because it directly affects chemical processes, nutrient solubility, and the physiology of aquatic organisms. Most freshwater organisms thrive in a relatively narrow range of pH 6.5–8.5, and waters that fall outside of this range can become stressful or even lethal to sensitive species. In general, headwater streams that drain forested, undeveloped areas may be slightly acidic (especially in regions with granite bedrock or organic soils), while values tend to become more neutral to slightly basic downstream as waters interact with carbonate-rich geology, soils, and cumulative inputs. By the time a river reaches its main stem and outlet, pH is often moderated by greater buffering capacity and mixing with tributaries. Anthropogenic factors such as acid rain, mining runoff, industrial discharge, or wastewater inputs can lower pH, while agricultural lime, concrete leaching, or algal blooms (through CO₂ uptake during photosynthesis) can raise pH. Natural processes, such as seasonal leaf litter decomposition or groundwater inputs rich in carbonates, can also shift pH without necessarily indicating unhealthy conditions. In general, pH between 6.5 and 8.5 is considered optimal for aquatic ecosystems, while sustained values below 5.5 or above 9.0 are critical and may cause direct harm to fish, invertebrates, and microbial communities. Because pH interacts with other chemical parameters such as hardness, alkalinity, and ORP, it provides key insight into the buffering capacity and chemical stability of a watershed.\npH doesn’t just affect aquatic organisms directly it controls the chemical form, solubility, and biological effects of nutrients and pollutants, shaping the entire ecology of a watershed.\n\nAmmonia (NH₃/NH₄⁺): The toxicity of ammonia increases as pH rises. At lower pH, ammonia exists mostly in the less toxic ionized form (NH₄⁺), while at higher pH (&gt;8.5), a greater proportion shifts to un-ionized NH₃, which is harmful to fish and invertebrates.\nPhosphates (PO₄³⁻): At neutral to slightly basic pH, phosphate tends to bind with calcium and magnesium, making it less available for algae. At lower pH, phosphate remains more soluble, which can enhance algal growth.\nMetals: The solubility of many heavy metals (e.g., aluminum, lead, copper) increases under acidic conditions, which can stress or kill aquatic life even at low concentrations.\nBuffering: Streams with adequate hardness and alkalinity can resist sharp pH swings, helping stabilize nutrient chemistry and reduce stress on organisms.\n\n\n\n4.2.8 Conductivity and specific conductance reflect the total ionic content of water\nConductivity and Specific Conductance are measures of the ability of water to carry an electrical current, which reflects the concentration of dissolved ions such as sodium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, and sulfate. Conductivity is the general term, while specific conductance refers to conductivity standardized to a reference temperature (usually 25°C) to allow comparison across sites and conditions. Both are measured using electronic probes and reported in microsiemens per centimeter (µS/cm). These parameters are important indicators of watershed health because they reflect the total ionic content of water, which can influence osmoregulation in aquatic organisms, nutrient availability, and overall chemical balance. In headwater streams, conductivity is usually low (&lt;100–150 µS/cm) because water has limited contact with mineral-rich soils and human inputs. As rivers progress downstream into the main stem and toward the outlet, conductivity often increases naturally due to accumulation of dissolved minerals from tributaries and groundwater, as well as interaction with soils and bedrock. Anthropogenic activities, including road salt application, wastewater discharge, agricultural runoff, and industrial effluents, can substantially elevate conductivity and specific conductance above natural background levels. Extremely high values (&gt;500–1000 µS/cm, depending on local context) can stress aquatic life and indicate pollution. Conversely, low conductivity may occur in very soft water or in waters dominated by precipitation inputs, which is not necessarily unhealthy. Interpreting conductivity requires understanding both natural geology and human impacts across the watershed to assess ecosystem health accurately.\nConductivity and turbidity together provide a fuller picture of both dissolved and particulate water chemistry. High values alone aren’t always harmful, but concurrent spikes in turbidity, conductivity, and nutrients can signal watershed stress and potential impacts to aquatic life. Conductivity and specific conductance reflect the total dissolved ionic content of water, while turbidity measures suspended particles. These parameters often interact in influencing nutrient dynamics:\n\nNutrient Transport: Many nutrients, especially phosphorus and some forms of nitrogen, attach to sediment particles. High turbidity events (e.g., after storms) can mobilize these particles downstream, increasing nutrient delivery. Dissolved ions measured as conductivity may also increase simultaneously due to runoff carrying salts, fertilizers, or wastewater.\nWater Chemistry Context: Conductivity provides a background measure of ionic strength, which can influence nutrient solubility, chemical speciation, and the mobility of metals bound to particles.\nAnthropogenic Drivers: Urban runoff, agriculture, and road deicing can simultaneously elevate turbidity, nutrient load, and conductivity, creating hotspots of altered water chemistry.\nNatural Variation: Seasonal rains, snowmelt, and erosion of mineral-rich soils can temporarily elevate conductivity and turbidity without indicating poor ecosystem health.\n\n\n\n4.2.9 Salinity\nSalinity is a measure of the total concentration of dissolved salts in water, primarily composed of sodium, chloride, magnesium, calcium, and potassium ions. It is typically measured using conductivity-based sensors, refractometers, or titration methods, and is reported in parts per thousand (ppt) or practical salinity units (PSU). Salinity is an important parameter for assessing watershed and estuarine health because it influences water density, osmoregulation in aquatic organisms, and the distribution of freshwater versus marine species. In freshwater systems, headwater streams typically have very low salinity (&lt;0.1 ppt), reflecting minimal contact with salts, while values may gradually increase downstream in the main stem due to cumulative natural inputs (e.g., mineral-rich soils or groundwater) and anthropogenic sources. Near the outlet and estuarine zones, salinity naturally increases due to tidal mixing and seawater intrusion. Human activities such as road salt application, wastewater discharge, industrial effluent, and agricultural runoff can elevate salinity in freshwater streams, potentially stressing or excluding sensitive species. Salinity levels in freshwater systems above 0.5–1.0 ppt may begin to cause stress for typical freshwater organisms, while higher concentrations can be toxic. Natural factors such as groundwater chemistry, tidal influence, or seasonal evaporation can also increase salinity without indicating poor ecosystem health. Monitoring salinity alongside other chemical parameters, such as chloride, TDS, and conductivity, helps provide a comprehensive understanding of watershed and estuarine ecosystem conditions.\n\n\n4.2.10 Chloride concentration are influenced by anthropogenic inputs\nChloride (Cl⁻) is a negatively charged ion (anion) commonly found in natural waters as part of salts such as sodium chloride (NaCl) and calcium chloride (CaCl₂). It is typically measured using colorimetric kits, ion-selective electrodes, or ion chromatography, and is reported in milligrams per liter (mg/L) or parts per million (ppm). Chloride is an important parameter for assessing watershed health because elevated concentrations can indicate anthropogenic inputs, such as road salt, wastewater effluent, or industrial discharge, and can be toxic to sensitive aquatic organisms at high levels. In natural systems, headwater streams usually have low chloride concentrations (&lt;10–20 ppm) because they are primarily fed by precipitation and groundwater with minimal human impact. As water flows downstream to the main stem and outlet, chloride concentrations can naturally increase slightly due to cumulative inputs from tributaries, but significant increases are often linked to human activities. Road salt application in winter, urban stormwater runoff, and wastewater effluent are common drivers of elevated chloride levels, which can disrupt osmoregulation in fish and invertebrates and affect community composition. Chloride concentrations above 230 ppm are considered concerning for chronic freshwater exposure, while acute toxicity may occur at higher levels. Natural factors, such as mineral-rich geology or seawater intrusion near estuarine zones, can also elevate chloride without necessarily indicating unhealthy conditions. Monitoring chloride alongside other chemical and physical parameters helps identify both natural variation and anthropogenic impacts across a watershed.\nMonitoring salinity together with chloride provides insight into both natural and human-influenced changes in dissolved salts, helping distinguish between healthy watershed conditions and potential stressors for aquatic life. Salinity and chloride are closely related because chloride ions (Cl⁻) are the dominant component of dissolved salts in most waters. Understanding their relationship helps interpret ecosystem health:\n\nContribution to Salinity: In freshwater and estuarine systems, chloride often accounts for the majority of salinity. Natural sources include groundwater leaching of minerals and seawater intrusion in estuaries, while anthropogenic sources include road salt, wastewater, and industrial effluent.\nEcosystem Impacts: Elevated chloride increases salinity, which can stress freshwater organisms by disrupting osmoregulation. High salinity can also affect species distribution, favoring salt-tolerant organisms and reducing biodiversity.\nAnthropogenic Drivers: Winter road salting, urban runoff, and wastewater discharges often simultaneously raise both chloride and salinity, contributing to cumulative stress in streams and rivers.\nNatural Variation: Salinity can increase naturally near estuarine zones due to tidal influence or in regions with mineral-rich geology. These increases do not necessarily indicate pollution.\n\n\n\n4.2.11 Nitrates and ammonium\nNitrates (NO₃⁻) and ammonium (NH₄⁺) are key forms of nitrogen in aquatic ecosystems and serve as important indicators of nutrient status and potential pollution. Nitrates are the oxidized, highly soluble form of nitrogen, commonly produced by microbial nitrification in soils or through fertilizer runoff, and are typically measured using colorimetric test kits, ion chromatography, or spectrophotometry. Ammonium is the reduced, ionized form of nitrogen, often derived from organic matter decomposition, wastewater, or livestock waste, and is measured using similar methods with specific reagents that detect NH₄⁺. Both are reported in milligrams per liter (mg/L or ppm). These compounds are important to monitor because excessive nitrogen can lead to eutrophication, algal blooms, oxygen depletion, and shifts in aquatic communities.\nIn a watershed, headwater streams generally have low nitrate and ammonium concentrations due to limited nutrient inputs and uptake by riparian vegetation, while values typically increase downstream in the main stem and outlet as cumulative inputs from tributaries, agriculture, and urban areas contribute additional nitrogen. Anthropogenic activities such as fertilizer application, wastewater discharge, livestock operations, and stormwater runoff can elevate both nitrate and ammonium levels, potentially causing ecological stress. Expected concentrations in relatively unimpacted streams are usually &lt;1 mg/L for ammonium and &lt;2 mg/L for nitrate, while levels above 10 mg/L nitrate or 2 mg/L ammonium can be concerning for ecosystem health, depending on local context. Natural factors, including soil mineralization, groundwater inputs, and seasonal decomposition of organic matter, can also influence nitrogen concentrations without necessarily indicating pollution. Monitoring both forms of nitrogen together provides a more complete picture of nutrient dynamics and potential anthropogenic impacts across a watershed.\nNitrogen compounds such as nitrates (NO₃⁻) and ammonium (NH₄⁺) are closely connected to other chemical and physical parameters in streams. Measuring nitrates and ammonium alongside TDS, conductivity, and turbidity allows managers to see how nutrients, dissolved ions, and suspended particles interact. This integrated view helps distinguish natural patterns from human-driven impacts in watersheds.\n\nTDS and Conductivity: Dissolved nitrogen contributes to the ionic content of water, slightly elevating TDS and conductivity. Monitoring these parameters together helps distinguish natural mineral contributions from nutrient enrichment due to human activity.\nTurbidity: Nitrogen is often associated with organic particles, sediment, or algae. Elevated turbidity can indicate increased transport of particulate-bound nitrogen, especially after storms or runoff events.\nAnthropogenic Drivers: Fertilizer runoff, wastewater, livestock operations, and urban stormwater can simultaneously elevate nitrogen, TDS, conductivity, and turbidity, highlighting areas of watershed stress.\nNatural Variation: Seasonal decomposition, groundwater inputs, and soil mineralization can increase nitrogen, conductivity, or turbidity without signaling poor ecosystem health.\n\n\n\n4.2.12 Phosphates\nPhosphates (PO₄³⁻) are a key form of phosphorus in aquatic ecosystems and an essential nutrient for plant and algal growth. Phosphates exist in both dissolved and particulate forms, with orthophosphate being the bioavailable dissolved form that most directly influences primary productivity. They are typically measured using colorimetric test kits, spectrophotometry, or ion chromatography and reported in milligrams per liter (mg/L or ppm). Monitoring phosphates is important because excessive phosphorus can lead to eutrophication, algal blooms, oxygen depletion, and altered aquatic communities.\nIn a watershed, headwater streams usually have low phosphate concentrations (&lt;0.05–0.1 mg/L) because of limited inputs from natural sources and efficient uptake by riparian vegetation. Concentrations tend to increase downstream in the main stem and outlet due to cumulative inputs from tributaries, soils, agricultural runoff, and urban areas. Anthropogenic factors such as fertilizer application, wastewater discharge, livestock operations, and urban stormwater can significantly elevate phosphate levels, potentially causing ecological stress. Levels above 0.1–0.3 mg/L are often considered elevated for freshwater streams, while &gt;0.5 mg/L can indicate nutrient enrichment that poses a risk for eutrophication. Natural processes, such as mineral leaching from soils, leaf litter decomposition, or sediment disturbance during storms, can also temporarily increase phosphate concentrations without indicating unhealthy conditions. Measuring phosphates alongside other nutrient and chemical parameters allows for a more complete assessment of watershed health and nutrient dynamics.\nPhosphates (PO₄³⁻) are an essential nutrient for aquatic plants and algae, but excessive levels can lead to eutrophication, oxygen depletion, and altered aquatic communities. Phosphate concentrations are closely connected to other chemical and physical parameters in streams. Measuring it alongside turbidity, TDS, conductivity, pH, ORP, and DO provides a more integrated view of nutrient dynamics, water chemistry, and overall ecosystem health across a watershed.\n\nTurbidity: Particulate-bound phosphate can increase during storms or runoff events, so elevated turbidity often signals higher transport of phosphorus.\nTDS and Conductivity: Dissolved phosphate contributes to the ionic content of water, influencing total dissolved solids (TDS) and conductivity. Monitoring these together helps distinguish natural versus anthropogenic contributions.\npH and ORP: The solubility and bioavailability of phosphate can be affected by pH and oxidation-reduction potential, with certain conditions promoting phosphorus release from sediments.\nDissolved Oxygen: Excessive phosphate can fuel algal growth, which may later lead to oxygen depletion when organic matter decomposes."

    "text": "4.3 Ask an interesting question\nn this lab, you will explore water quality across multiple sites in a watershed. To guide your analysis, you will formulate hypotheses using the IF–THEN–BECAUSE format. You will create hypotheses for each of the three categories of water quality parameters:\n\nPhysical Parameters (e.g., temperature, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, TDS, conductivity)\nChemical Parameters (e.g., pH, ORP, total hardness, chloride, salinity)\nNutrients (e.g., nitrate, ammonium, phosphate)\n\n\n4.3.0.1 Step 1: Choose Your Focus\nYou do not need to create completely separate hypotheses for each parameter. Instead, you can focus on a single ecological or watershed-related process and choose 2–3 parameters that indicate the same thing. Think through these examples:\n\nIf your goal is to explore nutrient enrichment, what parameters could you use to explore a single hypothesis?\nIf your goal is to explore human impact downstream, what parameters could you use to explore a single hypothesis?\nIf you want to explore coldwater habitat health, what parameters could you use to explore a single hypothesis?\n\nChoosing parameters that indicate the same ecological process allows you to test your hypothesis more robustly. Double check that you have one parameter from each category.\n\n\n4.3.0.2 Step 2: Use the IF–THEN–BECAUSE Format\n\nIF: State your prediction about a relationship between location or condition and the water quality parameter(s).\nTHEN: Predict the expected observation or trend in the data.\nBECAUSE: Explain the ecological or watershed rationale for your prediction. Remember, this is you actual hypothesis\n\nExample (note that this one uses three parameters from the same category!)\n\nIF downstream sites receive more urban and agricultural runoff, THEN nitrate, ammonium, and phosphate concentrations will be higher at these sites compared to headwaters, BECAUSE runoff from fertilizer and wastewater contributes nutrients to the river system.\n\n\n\n4.3.0.3 Step 4: Make It Specific and Testable\nTake a closer look at your hypothesis and double check that you are setting yourself up for success:\n\nFocus on a clear trend or difference between upstream and downstream sites, or headwater versus main stem versus outlet.\nAvoid vague predictions; your hypothesis should be something you can evaluate using the data you collected.\nRemember that we are situated in the Merrimack watershed: We have the South Branch Piscataquog Tributary from almost at origin to where it flows into the Merrimack at Manchester and then the Merrimack River from Manchester to just before it flows into the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n\n\n4.3.1 Formulate your hypothesis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive it a try\n\n\n\nState your hypothesis using the if-then-because format. You can use the cheatsheet below for reference.\nThen create a sketch of the figure you will use to visualize your data to determine if you are correct.\n\n\nHere is your cheatsheet with an overview of parameters, their interactions, ideas about potential expected spatial patterns, and anthropogenic impacts.\n\n4.3.1.1 Physical Parameters\nTemperature and Dissolved Oxygen (DO)\n\nTemperature: Regulates metabolic rates, solubility of oxygen, and distribution of aquatic species. Cold headwater streams provide critical habitat for sensitive species like brook trout.\nDissolved Oxygen (DO): Measures the amount of oxygen available for aquatic life (mg/L or ppm). High DO (&gt;7–8 mg/L) is ideal; very low DO (&lt;5 mg/L) stresses organisms.\nInteraction: Temperature inversely affects DO—warmer water holds less oxygen. DO also interacts with ORP, influencing redox reactions.\nSpatial Patterns: Headwaters typically have high DO and cooler temperatures; downstream, temperature may increase and DO may decrease due to respiration, decomposition, and nutrient loading.\nAnthropogenic Impacts: Nutrient enrichment, wastewater, and organic pollution can lower DO; damming and thermal discharges also affect temperature and oxygen.\n\nTurbidity and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)\n\nTurbidity: Cloudiness of water caused by suspended particles. High turbidity reduces light penetration and affects photosynthesis.\nTDS: Measures dissolved ionic content (ppm), including salts and minerals. Influences osmoregulation and nutrient dynamics.\nInteraction: High turbidity can transport particulate-bound nutrients like phosphorus and nitrogen. TDS often rises alongside conductivity.\nSpatial Patterns: Low in headwaters, naturally increasing downstream.\nAnthropogenic Impacts: Construction, agriculture, urban runoff, and stormwater can increase both turbidity and TDS.\n\nConductivity and Specific Conductance\n\nMeasures water’s ability to carry an electrical current, reflecting dissolved ion content. Specific conductance is standardized to 25°C.\nInteraction: Linked to TDS, turbidity, and nutrient transport. High conductivity often accompanies urban and agricultural runoff.\nSpatial Patterns: Low in headwaters; increases downstream due to cumulative mineral and anthropogenic inputs.\nEcological Implications: Excessive conductivity stresses freshwater species; natural geology can also influence baseline values.\n\n\n\n4.3.1.2 Chemical Parameters\npH\n\nMeasures hydrogen ion concentration (0–14 scale). Optimal range for freshwater ecosystems: 6.5–8.5.\nInteraction: Affects nutrient solubility (phosphate, ammonia) and toxicity of metals; influences buffering capacity with hardness and alkalinity.\nSpatial Patterns: Slightly acidic in headwaters draining forested or granite areas; neutral to slightly basic downstream.\nAnthropogenic Impacts: Acid rain, wastewater, agricultural lime, and algal activity can alter pH.\n\n\n\n4.3.1.3 ORP (Oxidation-Reduction Potential)\n\nMeasures water’s tendency to gain or lose electrons (mV). Positive values indicate oxidizing conditions; negative values indicate reducing.\nInteraction with DO: Low DO reduces ORP, leading to anaerobic conditions; high DO increases ORP, supporting aerobic life.\nSpatial Patterns: High ORP in well-oxygenated headwaters; decreases downstream with organic matter and nutrient loading.\nAnthropogenic Impacts: Wastewater, agricultural runoff, and industrial effluents can lower ORP.\n\nTotal Hardness\n\nMeasures calcium and magnesium ions (ppm as CaCO₃).\nInteraction: Linked to buffering capacity and pH stability; affects nutrient availability and aquatic physiology.\nSpatial Patterns: Low in headwaters depending on geology; increases downstream from mineral-rich soils, tributaries, and human inputs.\nAnthropogenic Impacts: Agriculture (lime), urban runoff, and industrial discharges can elevate hardness.\n\nChloride\n\nCl⁻ concentration (ppm) from natural minerals, road salt, or wastewater.\nInteraction: Contributes to salinity and TDS; elevated chloride can stress freshwater organisms.\nSpatial Patterns: Low in headwaters; increases downstream and near estuaries.\nAnthropogenic Impacts: Road salt, urban runoff, wastewater, and industrial effluents.\n\nSalinity\n\nTotal dissolved salts (ppt or PSU).\n\n**Interaction:** Closely linked to chloride; affects osmoregulation, species distribution, and TDS.\n\nSpatial Patterns: Minimal in headwaters; increases toward estuaries and marine influence.\nAnthropogenic Impacts: Road salt, wastewater, and industrial inputs; natural geology and tidal intrusion also affect salinity.\n\n\n\n4.3.1.4 Nutrients\nNitrates and Ammonium\n\nNitrates (NO₃⁻) are oxidized, highly soluble nitrogen; ammonium (NH₄⁺) is reduced nitrogen from decomposition or waste. Units: mg/L.\nInteraction: Contribute to TDS and conductivity; often associated with turbidity when particulate-bound. Excess nitrogen can fuel algal blooms and oxygen depletion.\nSpatial Patterns: Low in headwaters; increases downstream with cumulative agricultural, urban, and wastewater inputs.\nCritical Levels: Nitrate &gt;10 mg/L or ammonium &gt;2 mg/L can be concerning. Natural processes like soil mineralization can elevate levels without pollution.\n\nPhosphate\n\nPO₄³⁻ is an essential nutrient, measured as dissolved orthophosphate (mg/L).\nInteraction: Linked to turbidity (particle-bound), TDS, conductivity, pH, ORP, and DO. Phosphate availability influences primary productivity and oxygen dynamics.\nSpatial Patterns: Low in headwaters; increases downstream from agriculture, urban areas, and tributary inputs.\nCritical Levels: &gt;0.1–0.3 mg/L is elevated; &gt;0.5 mg/L indicates risk of eutrophication. Natural leaching and decomposition can also raise levels temporarily.\n\n\n\n\n4.3.2 The big research question\nIn science, no single experiment answers everything. Each study is a small but meaningful piece of a much larger puzzle—a “big research question” that scientists are trying to understand over time. The hypothesis you develop is like a targeted investigation: it focuses on a specific factor or process. However, the results you collect contribute to a broader understanding of how ecosystems function, how human activities affect watersheds, or how natural processes interact with environmental change. Thinking about the big research question helps you see your work in context and understand why it matters beyond the individual measurement or site. You can think of it metaphorically as your puzzle piece—your careful data collection and analysis provide evidence that moves the collective understanding forward, answering part of a larger puzzle that no single study can solve alone.\nLet’s find your big research question:\n\nStart with your hypothesis: Look at the specific process or trend you are testing (e.g., “nitrate concentrations are higher downstream of agricultural areas”).\nAsk “Why does this matter?”:\n\nConsider ecological, environmental, or societal implications.\nExample: Elevated nitrates downstream may affect algae growth, dissolved oxygen, or the health of coldwater fish populations.\n\n\n\n\nZoom out from the site-specific question:\n\nThink about the watershed as a whole.\nAsk how your observation connects to broader patterns of water quality, nutrient cycling, or human impacts on rivers.\n\n\n\n\nIdentify gaps in understanding: - Consider what is currently known and unknown about these processes. - Example: “We know nutrient inputs can cause eutrophication, but how do nutrient levels change along the full length of a river system from headwaters to estuary?”\n\n\n\nFormulate a potential big research question:\n\n-    It should be broader than your specific hypothesis.\n\n-    Example: “How do land use and human activities across an entire watershed influence water quality and ecosystem health from headwaters to the river mouth?\"\n\nReflect on the connection:\n\nWhich picture are you adding a missing puzzle piece to?\nWhich larger body of knowledge are you helping to build with your study?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive it a try\n\n\n\nFormulate your “big research question”.\nThen, use your big research question to justify why your study is worth the time and effort (e.g. why should somebody fund you to do this? What information will they gain? How could it be applied?)"

This allows us to look at two gradients and identify interactions among variables and connections between local measurements and broader watershed processes.\nThe study is designed to describe water quality along two interconnected watersheds in southern New Hampshire and northeastern Massachusetts: the South Branch of the Piscataquog River and the Merrimack River, from headwaters to the ocean.\n\nIn the South Branch of the Piscataquog, sampling begins at Rand Brook in Francestown, a small tributary representing a relatively pristine headwater site. Further downstream, samples were collected at the Lyndeboro Conservation Area, Howe Bridge, New Boston, and Rotary Park in Goffstown, which collectively capture areas where approximately 90% of the watershed flows past, integrating effects from forested, agricultural, and suburban landscapes. The final Piscataquog site, West Junior/ Deb Softball Fields in Manchester, is located just upstream of its confluence with the Merrimack River, representing a more developed, downstream environment.\nIn the Merrimack River, sampling begins at Delta Dental Stadium, a few miles upstream of where the Piscataquog joins the river, and continues downstream at Bedford Heritage Trail, Moore’s Falls Conservation Area (Litchfield, NH), Merrill Park (Hudson, NH), Lowell Heritage State Park (Lowell, MA), Pemberton Park (Lawrence, MA), Pines Recreation Area (Groveland, MA), and finally Deer Island (Amesbury, MA) at the river’s outlet to the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThis sequence of sites was chosen to capture the cumulative influence of urban, suburban, and natural landscapes on the river’s water quality, as well as the transition from freshwater to estuarine conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive it a try\n\n\n\nCreate a small sketch that shows the study area to help you visualize potential interactions and patterns.\n\n\n\n\n4.4.2 Sampling\nAt each study site, water samples were collected for laboratory analysis, and in situ measurements were taken using a multiparameter water quality probe. The water samples were used to determine nutrient concentrations, including chloride, nitrate, ammonium, phosphate, and total hardness while the probe provided real-time measurements of several physical and chemical parameters. These included temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), specific conductance, total dissolved solids (TDS), and salinity. Sampling was conducted consistently at each location to ensure that comparisons along the watershed, from headwaters to the river outlet, accurately reflect longitudinal patterns in water quality."

Use the chemical testing kits provided for each parameter, carefully following the instructions to prepare your samples, apply reagents, and develop the color reactions. Measure the concentrations using both the reference color sets and, where applicable, a spectrophotometer to obtain precise readings. Record all measurements on the data sheets provided, making sure to include the site, parameter, and units for each observation. Accurate and consistent data recording is essential, as your results will be used to compare water quality across the watershed. Following the same procedure at each site ensures that any differences you observe reflect real variations in water quality rather than experimental error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive it a try\n\n\n\nCarefully follow the instructions for each test kit and record your data as instructed."

Since we do not have replicate measurements for each site, you will not be able to perform statistical tests for significant differences. However, calculating summary statistics and creating clear plots will help you interpret patterns across sites and watersheds.\n\n4.6.0.1 Step 1: Identify Data Types\n\nReview each parameter in your dataset.\nDetermine if the parameter is continuous (numeric values that can take any value within a range, e.g., temperature, nitrate concentration) or categorical (grouped or discrete values, e.g., site names, watershed).\nBased on the data type, choose an appropriate plot:\n\nContinuous data over a gradient or sequence of sites: Line plot or scatter plot.\nCategorical comparisons (e.g., watershed averages): Bar plot.\nMultiple continuous variables to explore relationships: Scatter plot with one variable on the x-axis and the other on the y-axis.\n\n\n\n\n4.6.0.2 Step 2: Calculate Summary Statistics in Google Sheets\nYou will calculate measures of central tendency (mean, median) and variability (range, standard deviation) for each parameter across the dataset. Follow these steps:\n\nOpen your dataset in Google Sheets.\nLabel columns clearly for each parameter and site.\nCalculate the mean:\n\nSelect an empty cell.\nEnter =AVERAGE(range) where range is the cells containing the values for a parameter.\n\nCalculate the median:\n\nSelect and empty cell\nEnter =MEDIAN(range) in an empty cell.\n\nCalculate the standard deviation:\n\n-    Select and empty cell\n-    Enter `=STDEV(range)` in an empty cell.\n\nCalculate the range:\n\n-    Select an empty cell\n-    Enter `=MAX(range)-MIN(range)` in an empty cell.\n\nRepeat steps 3–6 for the dataset as a whole and then separately for each watershed system (South Branch Piscataquog and Merrimack River).\n\n\n\n4.6.0.3 Step 3: Create Visualizations in Google Sheets\n\nHighlight the data you want to plot.\nClick Insert → Chart.\nIn the Chart Editor, indicate your data range, then choose the chart type appropriate for your data.\nLabel axes clearly and include units.

For each parameter you will want to describe the following:\n\nsummary statistics\nspatial trends: two watersheds + whole picture\n\nFor each component identify the broad trend and notable highlights. Your written description should give context to your results as you describe the patterns (“increased”, “wider”, “smaller”). You can reference the The Academic Phrasebank for additional phrases that can be helpful.\nDevelop a narrative that will guide the reader through your results. This is called “lowering the cognitive burden” i.e. how much they have to think for themselves vs you making the results easily accessible and understandable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive it a try\n\n\n\nDescribe your summary statistics and your results related to your hypothesis. Remember that at this point you are just describing them, you are not interpreting them.\n\n\n\n\n4.7.2 Interpret and discuss your results\nSo far you have only described your results. Now it is time to interpret them.\nThis means that you need to place them back in to the context of your hypothesis and determine whether they support your hypothesis or not of if you cannot come to a definitive conclusion.\nA good way to do this is to summarize your key findings in a few sentences and then make a clear statement about how they related to your original hypothesis. You can follow the fill-in-the-blank-formula below.\n\nIn this study, I investigated [broad question asked + specific hypothesis tested]. To achieve this, I [specific data set + analysis used]. I found that [key results] which [statement about how this does or does not support your hypothesis].\n\nWhat your discussion looks like will depend on whether or not your results support your hypothesis. Think of this as discussing your results in the context of your specific research question for the study.\nIf your results support your hypothesis, you will want to elaborate on how they support your hypothesis. A good way to do this is to use the same break down of components you used for your results and for each component demonstrate how it supports your hypothesis. You will want to go back to the “because” component of your hypotheses to use that same reasoning. Even if your results do support your hypothesis you should acknowledge other possible explanations - this is where your controls come into play.\nIf your results do not support your hypothesis you will focus on what may have been incorrect or only partially correct about your reasoning for your initial hypothesis. You should still follow the same structure of your results, it can be helpful to contrast as “we expected x, we found y - here is a possible explanation”.\nMost typically you will have a bit of both, where certain aspects of your results support your hypothesis and others do not, in that case following the structure of your results and discussing each to show how it does/does not support your results, acknowledging constraints and other possible explanations will be the best way to structure your discussion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive it a try\n\n\n\nInterpret your results. Focus just on your specific question/hypothesis.\n\n\nFinally, you will want to discuss your results in the context of the “big research question” you presented in your opening paragraph.\nHere, you should consider the implications of your results in further the overall understanding of that “big question”: What do we know now that we didn’t know before? How do your results complement/contradict what we already know? Is there something unique about your specific location that makes your results stand out?\nThis typically leads to considering next steps, this will include things like refining the methods you applied to the study at hand, expanding your geographic region or spatial/temporal resolution, or designing a study that will allow to you look at a specific aspect of your findings, frequently to make it more conclusive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive it a try\n\n\n\nDiscuss your results. Connect your findings back to your big research question."
