    "text": "Course Logistics\nWelcome to our lab handbook for Introduction to Environmental Science (Fall 2025) - it will be continuously updated throughout the semester.\nOur lab component will comprise a semester long project exploring our local watershed. Our lab activities will produce data that is part of an ongoing collaborative research project investigating the effects of stream temperature variability on biodiversity across diverse geographic regions and urban/rural locations. You will have the opportunity to develop your own hypotheses and experiments and be exposed to a range of methods for data collection and analysis commonly employed in the environmental sciences, including field methods for sampling aquatic macroinvertebrates, using keys for species identification, computational tools of analyzing and visualizing stream temperature variability and species diversity, and GIS (geographic information systems). Our lab will have three parts, in the first few weeks you will be introduced to the local watershed and then you will spend the remaining semester developing your own research projects in groups and we will collect and analyze the data for your projects.\n\nPart 1: Exploring the hydrological, physical, and chemical characteristics of the Piscataquog watershed and headwater streams.\nPart 2: Research projects: Macroinvertebrate diversity of two headwater streams\nPart 3: Research Projects: Microplastics\n\nOver the course of the semester you will become increasingly independent in your ability engage in all aspects of the scientific process, starting with making observations on the foundation of which you will formulate a hypothesis, design an experiment to test this hypothesis and make predictions about the outcome, collect, visualize, and analyze data, and report your findings in a written format.\nAfter completing the lab component of this course, you will have a fundamental skill set that will allow you to\n\nmake observations and use these to formulate a question and generate a hypothesis.\ndesign an appropriate experiment to generate and collect data to answer your question.\ncollect, visualize, and analyze data using appropriate qualitative and quantitative methods.\ncommunicate your research findings to a general audience.\n\nFor the lab component of this course to run smoothly, you will need to take an active role in preparing for and participating in lab. It is your responsibility to be aware of communications made in the syllabus, through announcements on Canvas, or emails. While it is always our goal to make those in a timely fashion, some last minute calls may be unavoidable. Similarly, you are expected to arrive for your lab period on time and prepared for the planned activities, including completing all assigned tasks and/or reading assignments, bringing your laptop and charger, along with any lab-related handouts1. We will be working with a lot of digital documents this semester, avoid last minute computer-related disasters by saving your work frequently and regularly backing up your files on an external drive or the cloud that you can access from another computer. If you run into issues where you will not have access to a laptop, contact your instructor and Dr. O’Leary as quickly as possible so we can make sure you can participate e.g. by finding you an alternate laptop to complete assignment in/out of lab.1 For documents that are digital including write-ups of your study design, spreadsheets with data etc. make sure that you can easily access those during lab periods. For any hard copies make sure that you print those and bring them with you as instructed.\nAll members of a lab group are expected to contribute to the design of each project along with collecting and analyzing data. It’s important that you establish a good working relationship with your group and hold each other accountable for the contributions that you make to this project; this may involve scheduling meetings outside of lab time. Strive to be a good team player by making sure you are responsive to your group and have open lines of communication to arrange meetings and complete assignments. We will frequently combine data sets within and across groups to get large sample sizes and/or replicates, therefore it is critical that you complete out-of-lab assignments by the posted deadlines in order for your group to be able to progress through the research projects. Procrastination is frequently at the root of assignments not being completed well. When you are collaborating with others be mindful that your time management will impact the time management of others. Account for this both when you plan as a group how to divide up work and in how you complete tasks assigned to you by making sure to get started early enough to not hold up your group. While it is primarily your responsibility to coordinate and work with your group, if you are having difficulties with group members not contributing as agreed upon or other problems working together, please reach out to Dr. O’Leary or your lab instructor and we will step in to help facilitate a solution.\nAttendance in lab is mandatory. You are allowed one absence per semester. You should always inform both your instructor and Dr. O’Leary in writing (an email) of your absence before lab. If you will be missing lab due to a direct conflict with a planned college-sponsored event you must contact your instructor and Dr. O’Leary at least one week in advance as that will give us more flexibility in planning how you can complete the lab and/or assign alternative activities. Regardless of the reason you are missing lab, you are responsible for material covered in lab and completing any pre-lab and/or homework assignments associated with a missed lab period; we will communicate with you in which form you will need to make-up in-lab assignments and activities. Additionally, you should always contact your group members for the project(s) you are currently working on as soon as possible to learn what you will be responsible for on any group assignments.\nThis semester will include some field-based activities. Your safety is always a priority and while it is always our goal to design activities that are accessible to everyone and minimize risk there are more factors that we cannot control outside of the lab. Help us out by using common sense, keeping an eye on your lab mates, and advocating for yourself. For field-based activities please make sure that you check the weather conditions ahead of time and then ensure you are appropriately dressed in terms of layers to stay warm or cool, with shoes that can get muddy or wet. If it is sunny/hot out make sure to wear sun screen and/or a head covering, bring water etc. if you have any allergies or other medical conditions that might require emergency treatment, please let your instructor know and carry any medication you might need on you (inhaler, EpiPen, etc). Occasionally there may be unavoidable weather-related last minute changes, please make sure to check your email/Canvas for last minute notifications. If you are doing any field work on your own outside of lab time, please be mindful of your safety, at the very least let somebody know where you are going and when you expect to be back, ideally bring a buddy with you.\nAcademic dishonesty, including but not limited to cheating, plagiarism, or turning in someone else’s work as your own will not be tolerated. Make sure you are properly citing the sources of ideas, figures, data, etc. in your lab reports. Plagiarism not only includes direct, word-for-word quotations without identifying it as a direct quote using quotation marks and citing the source but also paraphrasing other people’s ideas, arguments, or structure without properly acknowledging them. Learning how to properly summarize and paraphrase information from an original source is an important skill, as we generally do not use word-for-word citations in the scientific reports in the natural sciences. While it is acceptable to use AI tools (e.g. grammarly) to assist you in correcting grammar, syntax or spelling or to generate synonyms for individual sentences, you should not use large-language models (such as ChatGPT, CoPilot, Claude etc.) to generate larger sections of text for you2. If you are unsure if you are properly attributing components of your written assignments, please come talk to Dr. O’Leary. Evidence of academic dishonesty will at minimum result in a zero on that assignment along with an automatic notification of the Dean.2 Given the definitions of plagiarism above consider how this can fall into both the narrow category of not attributing a direct citation. Additionally, you don’t know the extent to which the LLM is “borrowing” other peoples ideas, arguments, or structure of presenting them. As a results, you would not be properly attributing content and ideas to those sources."

    "text": "2 Characterizing the Piscataquog watershed\nThe goal of this lab is for you to gain a comprehensive understanding of watersheds are by building your own watershed and exploring our local watershed. After completing these exercises, you should be able to explain what a watershed is, identify its key components, discuss the vulnerabilities of watersheds, especially those arising from human activities, and argue for the importance of maintaining healthy watersheds from both human and ecosystem perspectives.\nDuring lab you will be introduced to three mapping tools that you will use to categorize and assess the ecosystem health of the Marrimack watershed using major assessment categories. The goal of this assignment is for you to get a broad overview of different categories that you can then use as context to understand the data sets we will explore and also compare “our” watersheds to others.\n\nHydrology: Characterization of the flow of water within the watershed, identifying sources, flow paths, and how water is stored and moves through the system.\nTemperature: Characterization of thermal regimes and how these determine habitat availability.\nWater quality: Characterization of physical and chemical characteristics including dissolved oxygen, nutrient levels, conductivity and others.\nHabitat & Biodiversity: Characterization of different types of habitats within the watershed and the species that depend on these habitats and the biodiversity within the watershed, and how changes in land use and water quality affect these habitats.\nLandscape and Geomorphology: Examination of the physical landscape of the watershed, including landforms, soil types, and vegetation, how these features influence water flow and ecosystem health, as well as how they may be affected by natural and anthropogenic changes.\nAnthropogenic Effects: Identification of human activities within the watershed, including urban development, agriculture, and industry and assessment of how these activities impact the watershed’s health and discuss potential mitigation strategies.\nEcosystem Health: Assessment of overall health of the watershed using major categories such as water quality, habitat integrity, biodiversity, and presence of invasive species as well as signs of ecosystem stress and resilience.\n\nThis week we will learn how to use three mapping tools that will allow us to characterize the Piscataquog Watershed:\n\nUSGS Streamstats\nStroud Water Research Center: Model my Watershed\nEPA How’s My Waterway?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive it a try\n\n\n\nWith your learning group use the mapping tools you have been introduced to to explore characteristics of the Piscataquog watershed, discuss your findings as a group, decide what your key findings are and determine how you can clearly communicate those. A good way to do this is to formulate 3-5 key statements, and then decide how to present details (tables, figures, maps, numbers). You probably have space to print 3-5 letter pages, remember that you want font sizes that are legible! The goal is that you “lower the cognitive burden” of your viewers - i.e. you have already done the thinking for them. Show up for lab with a plan of what you want to post on the poster board. You should also think about how you want to title the board as a whole and you section specifically. We will have some time at the beginning of lab for you to (very, very informally, you don’t even have to stand up) present what your group learned to the other groups. Then we’ll make a final decision on what needs to be printed and put up on the board.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider this\n\n\n\nWrite a short (250 - 500 words) reflection on what you are learning:\n\ndefine what a watershed is\ndescribe what you learned from your exploration using the mapping tools\noutline what questions you think would be interesting to further investigate about headwater streams in the Piscataquog watershed to better understand the health of these ecosystems."
