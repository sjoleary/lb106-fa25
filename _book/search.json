    "text": "Course Logistics\nWelcome to our lab handbook for Introduction to Environmental Science (Fall 2025) - it will be continuously updated throughout the semester.\nOur lab component will comprise a semester long project exploring our local watershed. Our lab activities will produce data that is part of an ongoing collaborative research project investigating the effects of stream temperature variability on biodiversity across diverse geographic regions and urban/rural locations. You will have the opportunity to develop your own hypotheses and experiments and be exposed to a range of methods for data collection and analysis commonly employed in the environmental sciences, including field methods for sampling aquatic macroinvertebrates, using keys for species identification, computational tools of analyzing and visualizing stream temperature variability and species diversity, and GIS (geographic information systems). Our lab will have three parts, in the first few weeks you will be introduced to the local watershed and then you will spend the remaining semester developing your own research projects in groups and we will collect and analyze the data for your projects.\n\nPart 1: Exploring the hydrological, physical, and chemical characteristics of the Piscataquog watershed and headwater streams.\nPart 2: Research projects: Macroinvertebrate diversity of two headwater streams\nPart 3: Research Projects: Microplastics\n\nOver the course of the semester you will become increasingly independent in your ability engage in all aspects of the scientific process, starting with making observations on the foundation of which you will formulate a hypothesis, design an experiment to test this hypothesis and make predictions about the outcome, collect, visualize, and analyze data, and report your findings in a written format.\nAfter completing the lab component of this course, you will have a fundamental skill set that will allow you to\n\nmake observations and use these to formulate a question and generate a hypothesis.\ndesign an appropriate experiment to generate and collect data to answer your question.\ncollect, visualize, and analyze data using appropriate qualitative and quantitative methods.\ncommunicate your research findings to a general audience.\n\nFor the lab component of this course to run smoothly, you will need to take an active role in preparing for and participating in lab. It is your responsibility to be aware of communications made in the syllabus, through announcements on Canvas, or emails. While it is always our goal to make those in a timely fashion, some last minute calls may be unavoidable. Similarly, you are expected to arrive for your lab period on time and prepared for the planned activities, including completing all assigned tasks and/or reading assignments, bringing your laptop and charger, along with any lab-related handouts1. We will be working with a lot of digital documents this semester, avoid last minute computer-related disasters by saving your work frequently and regularly backing up your files on an external drive or the cloud that you can access from another computer. If you run into issues where you will not have access to a laptop, contact your instructor and Dr. O’Leary as quickly as possible so we can make sure you can participate e.g. by finding you an alternate laptop to complete assignment in/out of lab.1 For documents that are digital including write-ups of your study design, spreadsheets with data etc. make sure that you can easily access those during lab periods. For any hard copies make sure that you print those and bring them with you as instructed.\nAll members of a lab group are expected to contribute to the design of each project along with collecting and analyzing data. It’s important that you establish a good working relationship with your group and hold each other accountable for the contributions that you make to this project; this may involve scheduling meetings outside of lab time. Strive to be a good team player by making sure you are responsive to your group and have open lines of communication to arrange meetings and complete assignments. We will frequently combine data sets within and across groups to get large sample sizes and/or replicates, therefore it is critical that you complete out-of-lab assignments by the posted deadlines in order for your group to be able to progress through the research projects. Procrastination is frequently at the root of assignments not being completed well. When you are collaborating with others be mindful that your time management will impact the time management of others. Account for this both when you plan as a group how to divide up work and in how you complete tasks assigned to you by making sure to get started early enough to not hold up your group. While it is primarily your responsibility to coordinate and work with your group, if you are having difficulties with group members not contributing as agreed upon or other problems working together, please reach out to Dr. O’Leary or your lab instructor and we will step in to help facilitate a solution.\nAttendance in lab is mandatory. You are allowed one absence per semester. You should always inform both your instructor and Dr. O’Leary in writing (an email) of your absence before lab. If you will be missing lab due to a direct conflict with a planned college-sponsored event you must contact your instructor and Dr. O’Leary at least one week in advance as that will give us more flexibility in planning how you can complete the lab and/or assign alternative activities. Regardless of the reason you are missing lab, you are responsible for material covered in lab and completing any pre-lab and/or homework assignments associated with a missed lab period; we will communicate with you in which form you will need to make-up in-lab assignments and activities. Additionally, you should always contact your group members for the project(s) you are currently working on as soon as possible to learn what you will be responsible for on any group assignments.\nThis semester will include some field-based activities. Your safety is always a priority and while it is always our goal to design activities that are accessible to everyone and minimize risk there are more factors that we cannot control outside of the lab. Help us out by using common sense, keeping an eye on your lab mates, and advocating for yourself. For field-based activities please make sure that you check the weather conditions ahead of time and then ensure you are appropriately dressed in terms of layers to stay warm or cool, with shoes that can get muddy or wet. If it is sunny/hot out make sure to wear sun screen and/or a head covering, bring water etc. if you have any allergies or other medical conditions that might require emergency treatment, please let your instructor know and carry any medication you might need on you (inhaler, EpiPen, etc). Occasionally there may be unavoidable weather-related last minute changes, please make sure to check your email/Canvas for last minute notifications. If you are doing any field work on your own outside of lab time, please be mindful of your safety, at the very least let somebody know where you are going and when you expect to be back, ideally bring a buddy with you.\nAcademic dishonesty, including but not limited to cheating, plagiarism, or turning in someone else’s work as your own will not be tolerated. Make sure you are properly citing the sources of ideas, figures, data, etc. in your lab reports. Plagiarism not only includes direct, word-for-word quotations without identifying it as a direct quote using quotation marks and citing the source but also paraphrasing other people’s ideas, arguments, or structure without properly acknowledging them. Learning how to properly summarize and paraphrase information from an original source is an important skill, as we generally do not use word-for-word citations in the scientific reports in the natural sciences. While it is acceptable to use AI tools (e.g. grammarly) to assist you in correcting grammar, syntax or spelling or to generate synonyms for individual sentences, you should not use large-language models (such as ChatGPT, CoPilot, Claude etc.) to generate larger sections of text for you2. If you are unsure if you are properly attributing components of your written assignments, please come talk to Dr. O’Leary. Evidence of academic dishonesty will at minimum result in a zero on that assignment along with an automatic notification of the Dean.2 Given the definitions of plagiarism above consider how this can fall into both the narrow category of not attributing a direct citation. Additionally, you don’t know the extent to which the LLM is “borrowing” other peoples ideas, arguments, or structure of presenting them. As a results, you would not be properly attributing content and ideas to those sources."

You will use your spray bottle to simulate rainfall and to test how differences in landscape features form watersheds and drainage divides.\nCrumble several pieces of newspaper into balls and/or create stacks of newspaper pieces and place them in your roasting pan. Use the masking tape to fix them in place. Cut open the trash bag and flatten out any wrinkles. Raise one side of your tray (e.g. with a big text book). Finally, cover the entire pan and its content with the plastic sheet - don’t worry if you have some excess material outside of your tray.\nCongratulations - you’ve just built your first watershed!

This semester we will study streams and rivers in the Merrimack watershed. The goal is to develop skills exploring maps, and to practice exploring questions in a less structured, investigative way.\nYou can access the Stroud Water Research Center: Model my Watershed tool using this link or as posted on Canvas.\nThink of the watershed as nested basins, where smaller sub-watersheds are contained within larger ones. Here are the streams and tributaries we will re-visit throughout the semester.\n\nSchoolhouse Brook is a headwater stream (1st order) that flows into Rand Brook, near the Crossing of Cressy Hill Road and Russel Station Road, Francestown (42.958314, -71.790332)\nRand Brook is a second order stream that flows ito the South Branch Piscataquog River near Russell Station Road/2nd Turnpike South (42.958892, -71.778077)\nSouth Branch Piscataquog River meets the Middle Branch Piscataquog River at Gregg Mill Rd and Rt-13 in New Boston and flow into the Piscataquog right before Goffstown\nThe Piscataquog River flows into the Merrimack at Manchester.\nThe Merrimack River flows into the Atlantic Ocean at Newport.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive it a try\n\n\n\nOnce you have been shown how to use the mapping tool to delineate a watershed, pick three levels at which you want to compare drainage basins.

You can either start at Newport and move through increasingly smaller tributaries or follow the track of a rain drop.\nRemember that you can manipulate the layers being shown on your map using the Layers box: * Streams: Continental US Medium Resolution Stream Network is probably most appropriate * You can use the different Coverage Grids to explore change in land use and examine how terrain and einvrionmental conditions vary across the watershed: You can choose from different time points to look at Land Use/Cover (click on the little i next to the layer to see a legend). You can also look at the different soil types, elevation profiles, slope and patterns of precipitation and temperature * Basemaps: Topography and Satellite imagery will be most useful and give you complementary perspectives.\nRemember that you can always zoom out to a continental level view of North America to compare our watershed to the rest of the country to determine if the patterns you are seeing are typical for a region/the country.\nWhen you have delineated a watershed you can use the Analyze Tab to explore information on streams, land use, soil, terrain, climate, point sources, and estimated numbers of farm animals. Explore how these features change at different scale. Consider differences between order of magnitude (a larger watershed will have more streams) vs different patterns (do the distribution of stream order change?).\nIdentify two key take-aways from your explorations that you find particularly interesting."

    "text": "2.2 The Water Cycle connects reservoirs of water in different spheres through specific processes\nWater is constantly moving through Earth’s systems, stored in reservoirs and transferred by processes. Most of Earth’s water is in long-term reservoirs like the oceans and glaciers, but small amounts in short-term reservoirs like the atmosphere or rivers drive many critical climate and ecological processes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider this\n\n\n\nDiscuss with your partner how you think water is distributed among different reservoirs in our earth-climate system.\nFill in the blanks below using the approximate % of total water stored in each reservoir:\nOceans: ______ %\nIce caps & glaciers: ______ %\nGroundwater: ______ %\nLakes, rivers, and wetlands: ______ %\nSoil moisture: ______ %\nAtmosphere: ______ %\nLiving organisms: ______ %\nCircle the reservoirs you think are long-term (water remains there for hundreds to thousands of years) and put a star next to the short-term reservoirs (water cycles through in days to weeks).\nWhat do you notice about the relative sizes of long- vs. short-term reservoirs?\n\n\nWater moves between reservoirs through processes. A process is any physical or biological mechanism that transfers water from one reservoir to another. Examples include:\n\nEvaporation – liquid water to water vapor.\nTranspiration – release of water vapor from plants.\nCondensation – vapor to liquid droplets (clouds).\nPrecipitation – rain, snow, sleet, hail falling from the atmosphere.\nInfiltration – water soaking into soils/groundwater.\nRunoff – water moving across the land surface into streams and rivers.\nMelting & Freezing – solid ↔︎ liquid transitions in ice and snow.\nSublimation & Deposition – solid ↔︎ vapor transitions in ice and snow.\n\nTogether, reservoirs and processes form a dynamic cycle where water continuously moves, storing and exchanging mass among Earth’s spheres (hydrosphere, cryosphere, atmosphere, biosphere, lithosphere).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider this\n\n\n\nPick two processes and describe them in your own words, include information about which reservoirs are connected and which sphere they are located in:\n\n\n\n\nCompare your description with your lab partner.\nTake another look at the list of processes and identify processes that directly involve the biosphere.\n\n\nBiogeochemical cycles are the natural movement and transformation of essential chemical elements including carbon, nitrogen, phosporous, and water through the biosphere (“bio”), and the non-living environment (“geo”) and the chemical processes that connect them. We will discuss other examples in more detail during the semester.\nAn easy way to think about these cycles is as reservoirs that are connected by specific processes. Reservoirs can be long- or short-term storage, and it is also important to consider whether reservoirs are bioavailable (chemicals are in a form that can be used by organisms) or not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive it a try\n\n\n\nOn the blank space below, create a schematic of the water cycle. Label and annotate the key reservoirs you include as well as the processes that connect them.\nChecklist for your diagram:\n\nInclude at least five reservoirs (label them clearly).\nConnect reservoirs with arrows and label the arrows with the process names.\nMark reservoirs as long-term or short-term.\nShow how multiple Earth spheres are represented (hydrosphere, cryosphere, atmosphere, biosphere, lithosphere) using labels and annotations.\nAdd at least one example of human influence (e.g., dam, irrigation, fossil fuel combustion, land use change).\n\nDiscuss with your lab partner why the water cycle is a good example of how the Earth’s spheres are interconnected (think back to our definition that the spheres are “open systems” with the freedom to exchange matter, energy, and mass).

    "text": "2.3 Exploring streamflow using the scientific Process\n\n2.3.1 Science is a verb\nAll forms of science share a common goal - to know more and better understand how the world operates. For scientific inquiry we typically employ two types of logical thinking inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning. Inductive reasoning moves from the particular to the general, by contrast, deductive reasoning moves from the general to the particular.\nFor descriptive science our goal is to observe, explore, and discover. Here, we typically employ inductive reasoning with the goal of developing a hypothesis or theory. To do this, we compile related observation to draw general conclusions. We make observations and record them to build large data sets that allow us to infer generalizations based on an analysis. The data sets can be qualitative or quantitative and are frequently supplemented with drawings, pictures/videos. By contrast, hypothesis-driven science begins with a specific question/problem and a proposed testable or answer/solution. In this case, we are using deductive reasoning to test a theory: We start with a general principle and use that to predict a specific outcome assuming it is true and we design an experiment to determine if our results support the hypothesis. Even though we have just described these two types of reasoning as a binary to understand the difference between the approaches, most scientific studies rely on both approaches.\nWe frequently differentiate between basic and applied science. While basic science (frequently also referred to as fundamental or pure science) sees to gain fundamental knowledge and understanding of natural phenomena for its own sake, applied sciences uses that basic knowledge to solve specific, practical problems and develop new technologies, products or interventions.\nToday we are going to familiarize ourselves with all these different aspects of the scientific process by exploring patterns of stream flow and precipitation.\nHydrologists use stream gauges to measure discharge (the volume of water flowing past a point in a river per unit time). These data provide critical insight into the functioning of watersheds, seasonal water availability, and responses to precipitation. You will use USGS stream gauge data to visualize flow patterns and, at the same time, learn how scientists frame questions and test ideas.\nScience often begins with description — identifying what patterns exist before asking why. This is especially common in the environmental sciences were long-term monitoring plays a central role.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive it a try\n\n\n\nYou will be provided with USGS streamflow data (daily mean discharge) and paired precipitation data for one stream gauge.\nAs part of your ditigal literacy assignment you should have created a folder for all your lab files called LB106. In that folder create a subfolder called 02_streamflow with subfolders for data and results.\nDownload the USGS stream gauge data and paired precipitation data for the Piscataquog USGS gauge located near at Howe Bridge in New Boston, as well as two locations on the Merrimack.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Exploratory analysis & visualizations (Descriptive Science)\nOnce you have downloaded the data follow your instructors cues to learn how to use a spreadsheet program like Excel to create simple visualizations.\nFor our first set of plots, we are using what is called a time series and our data represents continuous data.\n\nWe will visualize stream discharge over one year using a line plot.\nWe will use a barplot to visualize mean monthly discharge.\n\nThen we will compare two continuous variable, precipitation and discharge, which is typically done using a scatter plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider this\n\n\n\nDiscuss your results with your lab partner.\nA good rule of thumb for a description of results is to start with the general trend and to then describe notable highlights. Be sure to use terms like “higher”, “lower”, “similar” etc to contextualize your results but the actual numbers are just as important especially if somebody wants to compare their results to yours. For example it is important to now that e.g. “there was more rain in December” but to compare that to another location we would want not only want to know the trend but also how much rain there was.\nHere are a few things to look for:\n\nWhat patterns do you see in the data over the year? e.g. seasonal trends, peaks after storms\nWhich months are the highest/lowest? Are there environmental patterns that might explain this?\nDo higher precipitation events always lead to higher discharge? Is there a lag?\n\nDescribe your results for each figure (at this point, only describe, don’t interpret your results).\n\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Moving toward explanation (hypothesis-driven science)\nAfter describing patterns, scientists often propose explanations and test them. A handy way to develop a hypothesis is to use the If…then…because format. The if-then component is a prediction you are making - the because component is the actual hypothesis where you propose a mechanisms that is at play. Remember, a good hypothesis should be testable and falsifiable. You also should always double check whether you have the data to test your hypothesis or you can design an experiment to generate the data you need.\nExamples:\n\nIf precipitation increases, then streamflow will rise within one day because rainfall quickly runs off the surface.\nIf winter temperatures are above freezing, then discharge will increase because snow and ice are melting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive it a try\n\n\n\nWork with your partner to generate 3-5 hypothesis in the if-then-because format that we can test with the data at hand.\nDescribe how you will use the data to test your hypothesis (what will your figure look like) and then create a sketch of what your figure will look like if you are correct.\n\n\nWe will compare our hypothesis with the class and pick the one(s) we want to test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive it a try\n\n\n\n(Re)state the hypothesis you are testing and plot your data.\nDescribe your results and determine whether you were correct - this means that you are interpreting your data. You are not only describing what you “saw”, you are actively trying to explain why you are seeing this patterns. Your first step is to compare it your hypothesis and prediction - does it match? That is evidence that your hypothesis is not wrong. It doesn’t match? Well, now we have some explaining to do.\nA handy format to describe your findings is the following scaffold:\n\nIn this study, I investigated [broad question asked/hypothesis tested]. To achieve this, I [specific data set + analysis used]. I found that [key results] which [statement about how this does or does not support your hypothesis].\n\n\n\nEnvironmental Science incorporates both basic and applied science. For example, basic science would look to understand watershed processes, while applied scientists would use that understanding to improve flood prediction or water management.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider this\n\n\n\nReflect and restate what you learned about the scientific process.\n\nDefine what inductive reasoning is and what deductive reasoning is.\nUse your definitions to argue which of these examples falls into which category.\n\nYou see that discharge peaks after every rainstorm and conclude that precipitation drives streamflow.\nYou hypothesize that precipitation will cause an immediate increase in discharge and generate several scatter plots from different locations to determine if this principle holds.\n\nDefine what descriptive and hypothesis driven research is.\nThink back over your work today and categorize it as descriptive or hypothesis-driven research.\nCompare and contrast basic and applied science.\nIdentify one way your work today could be considered basic science and one way to could be considered applied science."

    "text": "2.4 Gauges to Cameras: Developing new tools to understand stream flow\nThe USGS operates thousands of stream gauges across the United States. These gauges measure stage (the height of water in a river or stream). Using a rating curve (an empirical relationship between stage and discharge), hydrologists convert stage into streamflow (volume of water per time).\nTypes of gauges include:\n\nStaff gauges – simple rulers mounted in streams to visually read stage.\nPressure transducers – measure water pressure to determine depth.\nRadar or acoustic sensors – mounted above the water to measure surface height.\n\nTogether, these tools help build hydrological regimes — descriptions of how streamflow changes over days, seasons, and years, including responses to storms, snow melt, and drought.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider this\n\n\n\nSmall streams such as headwater streams are especially difficult to monitor.\nDiscuss with your partner\n\nWhat factors might make it difficult to monitor headwater streams?\nWhy is it especially important to understand the hydrological regimes of headwater streams in the context of climate change and land-use impacts?\n\n\n\nA lower-cost, more flexible approach is to use wildlife cameras or other time-lapse photography systems to monitor small streams.\nHow it works:\n\nCameras are positioned to capture images of the stream channel over time.\nTraining data is created by annotating images (e.g., marking “flowing” vs. “dry,” or “low flow,” “medium flow,” “high flow”).\nAn AI/ML model is trained on these annotated images to learn patterns that correlate with streamflow.\n\nOnce trained, the model can predict flow conditions from new images, producing a hydrograph similar to one from a traditional gauge.\nCritical considerations:\n\nCamera positioning: Must clearly capture the water surface. Poor angles, glare, or obstruction can reduce accuracy.\nEnvironmental challenges: Snow, ice, vegetation growth, drought, or debris can complicate predictions.\nBaseline quality: Models are only as good as the annotated images used to train them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive it a try\n\n\n\nBefore lab this week you should have requested access to USGS’ Flow Photo explorer. We have installed cameras at two of our local headwater streams.\nYou will annotate a series of pictures to help initiate our model (this is very real, very important science you are engaging in).\nAfter annotating, discuss with your lab partner:\n\nWhat challenges did you encounter (ambiguous images, snow/ice, glare, vegetation)?\nWhy positioning, lighting, and seasonal variation matter for success\nHow does this approach compare to traditional gauges? What are advantages? Limitations?\nAs a freshly minted annotation-expert, what recommendations would you give a field biologist getting ready to install cameras for model development?"
