    "text": "Course Logistics\nWelcome to our lab handbook for Introduction to Environmental Science (Fall 2025) - it will be continuously updated throughout the semester.\nOur lab component will comprise a semester long project exploring our local watershed. Our lab activities will produce data that is part of an ongoing collaborative research project investigating the effects of stream temperature variability on biodiversity across diverse geographic regions and urban/rural locations. You will have the opportunity to develop your own hypotheses and experiments and be exposed to a range of methods for data collection and analysis commonly employed in the environmental sciences, including field methods for sampling aquatic macroinvertebrates, using keys for species identification, computational tools of analyzing and visualizing stream temperature variability and species diversity, and GIS (geographic information systems). Our lab will have three parts, in the first few weeks you will be introduced to the local watershed and then you will spend the remaining semester developing your own research projects in groups and we will collect and analyze the data for your projects.\n\nPart 1: Exploring the hydrological, physical, and chemical characteristics of the Piscataquog watershed and headwater streams.\nPart 2: Research projects: Macroinvertebrate diversity of two headwater streams\nPart 3: Research Projects: Microplastics\n\nOver the course of the semester you will become increasingly independent in your ability engage in all aspects of the scientific process, starting with making observations on the foundation of which you will formulate a hypothesis, design an experiment to test this hypothesis and make predictions about the outcome, collect, visualize, and analyze data, and report your findings in a written format.\nAfter completing the lab component of this course, you will have a fundamental skill set that will allow you to\n\nmake observations and use these to formulate a question and generate a hypothesis.\ndesign an appropriate experiment to generate and collect data to answer your question.\ncollect, visualize, and analyze data using appropriate qualitative and quantitative methods.\ncommunicate your research findings to a general audience.\n\nFor the lab component of this course to run smoothly, you will need to take an active role in preparing for and participating in lab. It is your responsibility to be aware of communications made in the syllabus, through announcements on Canvas, or emails. While it is always our goal to make those in a timely fashion, some last minute calls may be unavoidable. Similarly, you are expected to arrive for your lab period on time and prepared for the planned activities, including completing all assigned tasks and/or reading assignments, bringing your laptop and charger, along with any lab-related handouts1. We will be working with a lot of digital documents this semester, avoid last minute computer-related disasters by saving your work frequently and regularly backing up your files on an external drive or the cloud that you can access from another computer. If you run into issues where you will not have access to a laptop, contact your instructor and Dr. O’Leary as quickly as possible so we can make sure you can participate e.g. by finding you an alternate laptop to complete assignment in/out of lab.1 For documents that are digital including write-ups of your study design, spreadsheets with data etc. make sure that you can easily access those during lab periods. For any hard copies make sure that you print those and bring them with you as instructed.\nAll members of a lab group are expected to contribute to the design of each project along with collecting and analyzing data. It’s important that you establish a good working relationship with your group and hold each other accountable for the contributions that you make to this project; this may involve scheduling meetings outside of lab time. Strive to be a good team player by making sure you are responsive to your group and have open lines of communication to arrange meetings and complete assignments. We will frequently combine data sets within and across groups to get large sample sizes and/or replicates, therefore it is critical that you complete out-of-lab assignments by the posted deadlines in order for your group to be able to progress through the research projects. Procrastination is frequently at the root of assignments not being completed well. When you are collaborating with others be mindful that your time management will impact the time management of others. Account for this both when you plan as a group how to divide up work and in how you complete tasks assigned to you by making sure to get started early enough to not hold up your group. While it is primarily your responsibility to coordinate and work with your group, if you are having difficulties with group members not contributing as agreed upon or other problems working together, please reach out to Dr. O’Leary or your lab instructor and we will step in to help facilitate a solution.\nAttendance in lab is mandatory. You are allowed one absence per semester. You should always inform both your instructor and Dr. O’Leary in writing (an email) of your absence before lab. If you will be missing lab due to a direct conflict with a planned college-sponsored event you must contact your instructor and Dr. O’Leary at least one week in advance as that will give us more flexibility in planning how you can complete the lab and/or assign alternative activities. Regardless of the reason you are missing lab, you are responsible for material covered in lab and completing any pre-lab and/or homework assignments associated with a missed lab period; we will communicate with you in which form you will need to make-up in-lab assignments and activities. Additionally, you should always contact your group members for the project(s) you are currently working on as soon as possible to learn what you will be responsible for on any group assignments.\nThis semester will include some field-based activities. Your safety is always a priority and while it is always our goal to design activities that are accessible to everyone and minimize risk there are more factors that we cannot control outside of the lab. Help us out by using common sense, keeping an eye on your lab mates, and advocating for yourself. For field-based activities please make sure that you check the weather conditions ahead of time and then ensure you are appropriately dressed in terms of layers to stay warm or cool, with shoes that can get muddy or wet. If it is sunny/hot out make sure to wear sun screen and/or a head covering, bring water etc. if you have any allergies or other medical conditions that might require emergency treatment, please let your instructor know and carry any medication you might need on you (inhaler, EpiPen, etc). Occasionally there may be unavoidable weather-related last minute changes, please make sure to check your email/Canvas for last minute notifications. If you are doing any field work on your own outside of lab time, please be mindful of your safety, at the very least let somebody know where you are going and when you expect to be back, ideally bring a buddy with you.\nAcademic dishonesty, including but not limited to cheating, plagiarism, or turning in someone else’s work as your own will not be tolerated. Make sure you are properly citing the sources of ideas, figures, data, etc. in your lab reports. Plagiarism not only includes direct, word-for-word quotations without identifying it as a direct quote using quotation marks and citing the source but also paraphrasing other people’s ideas, arguments, or structure without properly acknowledging them. Learning how to properly summarize and paraphrase information from an original source is an important skill, as we generally do not use word-for-word citations in the scientific reports in the natural sciences. While it is acceptable to use AI tools (e.g. grammarly) to assist you in correcting grammar, syntax or spelling or to generate synonyms for individual sentences, you should not use large-language models (such as ChatGPT, CoPilot, Claude etc.) to generate larger sections of text for you2. If you are unsure if you are properly attributing components of your written assignments, please come talk to Dr. O’Leary. Evidence of academic dishonesty will at minimum result in a zero on that assignment along with an automatic notification of the Dean.2 Given the definitions of plagiarism above consider how this can fall into both the narrow category of not attributing a direct citation. Additionally, you don’t know the extent to which the LLM is “borrowing” other peoples ideas, arguments, or structure of presenting them. As a results, you would not be properly attributing content and ideas to those sources."

You will use your spray bottle to simulate rainfall and to test how differences in landscape features form watersheds and drainage divides.\nCrumble several pieces of newspaper into balls and/or create stacks of newspaper pieces and place them in your roasting pan. Use the masking tape to fix them in place. Cut open the trash bag and flatten out any wrinkles. Raise one side of your tray (e.g. with a big text book). Finally, cover the entire pan and its content with the plastic sheet - don’t worry if you have some excess material outside of your tray.\nCongratulations - you’ve just built your first watershed! The plastic is the earth’s surface and your newspaper shapes form landscape features.\nTogether with your partner, identify key features on your watershed:\n\nmountains/hills, ridge lines and valleys.\nrivers, streams (linear flow)\nponds, lakes (pooling water in low areas)\ndrainage divides (rain flows to one side or the other)\n\nUse the markers to indicate how you think water will flow on your plastic sheet using arrows.

This semester we will study streams and rivers in the Merrimack watershed. The goal is to develop skills exploring maps, and to practice exploring questions in a less structured, investigative way.\nYou can access the Stroud Water Research Center: Model my Watershed tool using this link or as posted on Canvas.\nThink of the watershed as nested basins, where smaller sub-watersheds are contained within larger ones. Here are the streams and tributaries we will re-visit throughout the semester.\n\nSchoolhouse Brook is a headwater stream (1st order) that flows into Rand Brook, near the Crossing of Cressy Hill Road and Russel Station Road, Francestown (42.958314, -71.790332)\nRand Brook is a second order stream that flows ito the South Branch Piscataquog River near Russell Station Road/2nd Turnpike South (42.958892, -71.778077)\nSouth Branch Piscataquog River meets the Middle Branch Piscataquog River at Gregg Mill Rd and Rt-13 in New Boston and flow into the Piscataquog right before Goffstown\nThe Piscataquog River flows into the Merrimack at Manchester.\nThe Merrimack River flows into the Atlantic Ocean at Newport.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGive it a try\n\n\n\nOnce you have been shown how to use the mapping tool to delineate a watershed, pick three levels at which you want to compare drainage basins. Explore key characteristics and discuss your findings with your lab group (ProTip: Form an alliance with another lab group so you can have several laptops open with watersheds at different scales.)\nYou will want to trace the entire path from Schoolhouse Brook to the Merrimack at Manchester and from there two Newport to get a broad overview. You can either start at Newport and move through increasingly smaller tributaries or follow the track of a rain drop.\nRemember that you can manipulate the layers being shown on your map using the Layers box: * Streams: Continental US Medium Resolution Stream Network is probably most appropriate * You can use the different Coverage Grids to explore change in land use and examine how terrain and einvrionmental conditions vary across the watershed: You can choose from different time points to look at Land Use/Cover (click on the little i next to the layer to see a legend). You can also look at the different soil types, elevation profiles, slope and patterns of precipitation and temperature * Basemaps: Topography and Satellite imagery will be most useful and give you complementary perspectives.\nRemember that you can always zoom out to a continental level view of North America to compare our watershed to the rest of the country to determine if the patterns you are seeing are typical for a region/the country.\nWhen you have delineated a watershed you can use the Analyze Tab to explore information on streams, land use, soil, terrain, climate, point sources, and estimated numbers of farm animals. Explore how these features change at different scale. Consider differences between order of magnitude (a larger watershed will have more streams) vs different patterns (do the distribution of stream order change?).\nIdentify two key take-aways from your explorations that you find particularly interesting."
